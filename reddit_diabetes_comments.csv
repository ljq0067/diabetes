buzzybody21,2022-05-20,3,"If youre prescribed just a run of the mill benzo or antidepressant, you have nothing to worry about. 

What you do need to be concerned about are meds prescribed for bipolar disorder and other mood disorders. I have bipolar 1, and have been on several antipsychotics and mood stabilizers that have made me insulin resistant, thus making my blood sugar higher (normal going from 175 to 300 and difficult to manage). 

Because your pancreas produces plenty of insulin, I doubt youll experience much if any side effects."
houseofmyth,2022-05-20,1,"I used to be on antipsychotics. They may try to prescribe them again- I guess if I end up taking them I'll pay more attention to my sugars. I'm already insulin resistant, but I was put on metformin, so I shouldn't spike anymore. (Right?)"
reesecheese,2022-05-20,3,You might be fine 20/21 days but that one day will mess you up. Why? Because diabetes is a handful and likes to screw around with you.
houseofmyth,2022-05-20,0,Learning that the hard way :( So you're implying that I shouldn't risk the blood sugar spike?
reesecheese,2022-05-20,2,"If it was me, I'd get my mental health in order as well as my BG. Stress can raise your levels just by existing in this world. Oh and it is me, bc I take meds for my mental health!"
Angieboo2000,2022-05-20,3,I actually am on Wellbutrin and Zoloft and it doesnt mess with my sugars that much. I had to adjust my diet tho because I have an body dysmorphia and it did cause a little weight gain. But outside of that it didnt bother my sugar levels
houseofmyth,2022-05-20,2,"Oof honestly I am a bit afraid of weight gain, not only because of dysmorphia but I had to lose 20 pounds to help with my insulin resistance. Thank you so much for the heads up!"
Angieboo2000,2022-05-20,1,"From what the doctor said it was completely normal and it wasnt weight by fat. It was more water weight, however to use normal people who arent medically inclined in the difference, it was scary to me (it wasnt more then 5 lbs but it was a lot to me). I would just express that concern and talk with the doctor for medication that wont add to that stress. And keep a little notebook and document everything you can. But best of luck to you!"
thatawesomeperson98,2022-05-20,3,"I take zoloft and it doesnt really affect it too much but yes some meds can affect it , i was taking an antibiotic last year and my levels would not come out of the 180-200 range no matter what i did. (It was like 185 fasting one day =, my normal fasting is usually 90-110ish)"
cwidds20620,2022-05-20,2,I'm on Lexapro for my anxiety and Adderall for my ADD. I haven't noticed an issue with my BG but I'm also on the tslim insulin pump and Dexcom G6 cgm.. so my pump may be keeping it in check without me seeing a big difference. Not sure how much this helps =B
beeetusboi,2022-05-20,2,"This is the ideal combination, I do it, just need to eat better lol addy helps my numbers but the mass of carbs don't"
DiabeticCumshot,2022-05-20,1,Does the adderall make you lose your hunger at all?
cwidds20620,2022-05-20,1,I take an extended release dose and it's just enough to keep me focused but not enough that I never eat.
owllady,2022-05-20,2,"I'm on Geodon, Buspar, Trazodone, Hydrozyxine, Lamictal.  I have Bipolar 1 and GAD.  I took Zyprexia and it is what pushed me over into diabetes type 2.  Just ask your psychiatrist what can cause insulin resistance and you should be ok.  I know there are a few antipsychotics that can.  Also there are a lot of antipsychotics that cause weight gain for sure too.  Just ask the doc.  They will know.  Geodon is a weight neutral drug.  So is lamictal.  I have to be on an anti psychotic drug and also a mood stabilizer.  

For diabetes I take alogliptin, metformin, and lantus."
TheDeFecto,2022-05-20,2,"Viibryd 20mg, treats dx of depression and anxiety for me in one pill, no side effects at all. If I'm not medicated the depression gets to a point where it's very hard to manage my disease."
earth_echo,2022-05-23,2,"I'm bipolar type 1.  I take 300mg of Seroquel per day.  I am also diabetic.  I control my diabetes through diet (keto).  The Seroquel hasn't had any effect on my blood sugar levels or weight.  Yeah....keto diet solves the problem.  Low carbs = low blood sugar levels.

Many psych meds cause an increase in appetite, which most people respond to by eating sugary and carb-laden foods.  At the root of it, over consumption of carbs is the prob and not the medication itself.  So, if you keep your diet in-check, you should be fine."
imsadimsadimsad,2022-05-24,2,"ive taken Prozac, trazodone, trileptal, clonidine, buspar, hydroxyzine, Celexa, Xanax, Valium, and Lamictal with no effect on sugars whatsoever I didnt take all those altogether but Ive taken them all at some point or another"
cerulean4224,2022-05-12,3,I started taking a potassium supplement and it has helped tremendously.
Revolutionary_Cow243,2022-05-12,2,"To my knowledge, the pins and needles sensation isnt just twitches. But muscle twitches could be caused by stress, caffeine, low vit D levels (personally had this). Low vit D can also spike BG."
Harambe1983,2022-05-12,2,I been supplementing vitD 5000 ui. (I was low on blood test months ago). Was vitD deficiency causing you to twitch ?
Revolutionary_Cow243,2022-05-12,1,"A severe one, my level was 6 and the minimum i think is 50."
4thshift,2022-05-12,2,"They are fasciculations and are usually considered harmless and common. Many possible causes, but could be of serious concern if early sign of a neurological disorder.  Could be electrolytes  but if you are taking supplements or drinking lots of sports electrolyte products before it started, and it is not going away, perhaps that is the cause and not the cure. 

Also, excess caffeine, excess stress. You just dont want to ignore it though for too long because wouldnt want it to be something like MS undiagnosed. 

If you have a YouTube channel, post your video there with a title about muscle twitches  and tons of people will tell you they have the same thing and dont know what to do about it. Though, if you know you are diabetic, and your glucose is not in a normal range, obviously do your best to get into a better range most of the time. 

A basic cheap blood panel can look at your electrolytes, but vitamin/minera tests can be more expensive. Ask your doctor. A neurologist if it doesnt lighten up."
PM_ME_YOUR_DND_SHEET,2022-05-12,1,"I have had twitches like that in my calves and legs for years and years before I was (at least diagnosed) diabetic. No low carb at the time. Used to get really bad leg cramps as well especially when laying down. I would wake up with sudden intense leg pain and have to walk around a bit to get it to go away. The twitching wasn't painful, but I was very aware it was happening. Usually would go away if I tried to move my leg in order to see it better. 

The strangest thing is that once I got both my calves tattoo'd, the cramps and the twitching went away pretty immediately. Can't explain it. Haven't had any twitching or cramps ever since. 

Sorry I can't be more help, but I know what you're talking about!"
ChronicallyIllBadAss,2022-05-13,1,I get those all the time!  I do low carb cuz I feel better eating that way.  Maybe its a low vitamin like b12?
Harambe1983,2022-05-13,1,How low carb do u go? B12? Hmm possible
ChronicallyIllBadAss,2022-05-13,1,"I try to go no to low, like no processed carbs but I still eat vegetables and fruit"
Harambe1983,2022-05-13,1,Did twitches went away when you go that carb amount
ChronicallyIllBadAss,2022-05-13,1,"They have not, I just get less sick when I eat low carb but I also found out my B12 is low that is what I think is causing them"
Harambe1983,2022-05-14,1,did you supplement b12 or take b12 shots now? and it still dont go away?
ChronicallyIllBadAss,2022-05-14,1,Not yet still waiting for the meds
DeanaF04,2022-05-13,1,"I have this too and mine is related to low carb. I supplement magnesium and potassium, and drink 1-2 cups of bouillon a day. Sports drinks dont provide enough electrolytes for me."
Harambe1983,2022-05-13,1,"What do you mean that yours is related to low carb? If you increase your carb, it fix it?   How many potassium and magnesium do you supplement?  I think my low carb makes me flush these electrolytes as well. How long did you have it and how long to fix it"
ComplexChica,2022-05-13,1,"I have/had  the same issue. For me, it happens frequently when I lay down at night to go to bed.  When I brought it up to my PCP she stated that it could be caused by potassium deficiency.  I also living in a northern part of the US, am vitamin D deficient so much so, that I had to be on 50,000 ui for a period of 6 weeks to get my levels back to normal. So I'm not sure if it was the potassium or vitamin d in the end. Just something to consider."
Harambe1983,2022-05-13,1,Did the issue resolved?
Graveyardhag,2022-05-23,39,"Oooh man. If your mum requires a full time carer then disregard this but...

Look, your heart is in the right place but you can't do this for her. It's your mum's responsibility to manage her own diabetes. 

None of the stuff you have listed in your post was your responsibility in any way. It's not up to you to provide her testing gear, make her test, study how to manage diabetes, care for a parent (???) Make her eat the right food or make her exercise. 

I'm not even going to say anything about your sister lol.

You can't help someone who doesn't want to help themselves, if your mum doesn't care about her diabetes now, nothing you say or do is going to change her mind until she is ready to deal with it herself. 

Please don't take this all on, it isn't up to you to do any of this."
vastmagick,2022-05-23,8,"So I want to start with you can't make anyone do what you want when it comes to diabetes.  It is their disease and unless you remove their free will they will do what they want.  I get that this can be hard to handle since you only want the best for them, but taking away their free will is not going to help.

There isn't one way to treat diabetes and if your mom isn't a fan of the one way you are suggesting she treat her diabetes, she should talk with a doctor about other treatment options.  Because you are right that letting diabetes go untreated can have bad effects on the body.

As for diet, every diet has pros and cons.  Keto can be harmful to the heart and kidneys.  Low carb can miss vitamins and minerals and potentially cause low blood sugar episodes.  Low fat diets can increase your blood sugar if not paired with exercise.  There is no one diet that solves everything for everyone.  A diet should match the person's lifestyle and should be something they want to do.  If you force a diet on an adult, they will just sneak what they want when you aren't looking."
Goldang,2022-05-23,4,"If she doesn't start taking care of herself, ask your mom to fill out a will and list what she wants for funeral arrangements.

She's an adult, and if she doesn't want to deal, you can't really force her until she's unconscious in a hospital."
in_the_sheyd,2022-05-23,9,"It sounds to me like your mother and your sister are independent adults and dont want you managing their diabetes. You need to respect that and stop trying to control the way they eat or otherwise manage their condition.

Furthermore, you werent doing a good job listening to your mothers needs when she approached you about her leg. She wasnt asking you if she should be worried or if she should seek medical attention. She was asking you if you could help her research ways to control the swelling.

For the record one of the best ways to address edema when you cannot fix whatever is causing it is to elevate the limb so that it rests above the level of the heart and stay like that for some time every day."
Suitable-Regular8813,2022-05-23,5,"After thinking a bit, youre right. I was a bit of a control freak about my mother diabetes. I was too focused on the diabetes than the question. Gonna listen than honing in on diabetes."
StrangerGlue,2022-05-23,5,"I'd recommend statements like:

""What I researched made me feel mom needs medical advice. You already know how I feel; I can't help you research other things until she's been seen. Can I help book mom a doctor's appointment though?""

If they say no... just disengage. Unless your mom isn't competent to manage her health, it's not your job.

Especially if you're a minor (and I think you might be), feeling like you have to parent your mom into taking care of herself is a hard, hard place to be in. Be gentle on yourself, but you can be firm with your family. You were asked to help, and you did  now it's up to her to decide what to do with the info you found.

I do lymphatic massage on my mom's legs, but also she was seen by a doctor for her legs first."
jellyn7,2022-05-23,5,"As a librarian, we can do research for people, but we can't give medical advice. So while I could read a patron a webpage that talks about elevation or compression stockings, I am also going to say SPEAK TO A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL.

But one thing I noticed is you said you're doing the groceries, you don't want your mum to eat something? Don't buy it (if possible of course) also following (at least) a healthy diet and (most helpful) the diet your mum will be yourself could help a lot even if it will be just you and not your sister.

Stargazer_0101,2022-05-23,1,"Your mom with swollen legs is a sign of water retention, which comes with diabetes. She needs to tell her doctor about it so they can look into it. It could be edema, which can be quite serious. I just finally got that diagnosis after suffering for 35 years. 

And as for diet, both mom and sister needs to get with an Diabetes Educator and Dietician. For they need to make changes according to what they eat. Not all diets work the same since we are all different, even your mom and sister. 

I know this is hard on you, they need patience and guidance from professionals. Good luck in getting them professional help, for they have a long journey ahead if they want control. You are a good son and brother to look into this. And you will also have to learn how to read labels and know what they should be eating. They will get there in time. Just keep at them, not to rough, for they will push back. Good luck to all of you."
Julie1760,2022-05-23,-1,"I'm so sorry they aren't taking it seriously, it seems like you really care about your mother, and really want the best for her.

The most you can do is offer information. I do agree that the ada recipes in my opinion have WAY too many carbs for those of us with type 2.  the Keto diet along with intermittent fasting and regular exercise, has personally helped me bring my A1C from 7.5 down to 5.3."
LittleRedPooka,2022-05-24,-1,"The keto diet will help, but ALL carbs count for a diabetic. Where as in keto, the fiber carbs dont count.

cmhbob,2022-05-17,9,"Remember that the higher you go, the more insulin you need to correct the high. The correction you give for 200, for example, won't likely be enough to correct 300.

Miserable_Bread-,2022-05-17,4,"I don't think going to the hospital/doctor is going to help at this point. You have checked for ketones and they are not present. You are taking insulin and monitoring. If you had high ketones and high sugars with additional symptoms then yes, but given what you said I see no point in a visit to a doctor. But by all means call your endo and seek advice. 

Tbh. I would rage bolus, take more than normal and then some. And see things go. Monitor closely and have snacks at the ready if you start to drop fast. I'd consider going for a short walk too, and if you haven't been eating have a low carb snack."

38willthisdo,2022-05-17,3,"I agree with the other commenters- if you are not actively sick or stressed, sometimes stubborn highs can herald an upcoming UTI, yeast infection or sickness (Ive experienced all of those....you get your ah ha! moment when the symptoms eventually start showing). Another thought (although not as likely) is maybe your insulin has gone bad? I will also bolus a couple units at night if my sugars are acting high throughout the night."
Animelover1104,2022-05-17,2,I've thrown away the insulin that I was using and it still doesn't help. But I'll try doing a couple more units at night.
38willthisdo,2022-05-17,2,"It sucks when you cant figure out blood sugar weirdness- I just replaced my glucose meter (I use a cgm with multiple injections) because Im finding significant differences between my cgm data and A1C, and my endo and I have eliminated most of the common reasons for the difference in value. Turns out the old meter was still accurate. Go figure. I hope youre able to figure out whats happening with your sugars!"
chronically-clumsy,2022-05-17,3,"This is not advised by doctors but it works. Take the correct dose to bring you down and then take a (shorter) hot shower. It causes the insulin to act very quickly and often helps drop you quickly. Just be very careful so that you dont pass out.

If you have any pens, take a shot with a pen. That helps"

All_Hail_King_Sheldn,2022-04-25,12,"**I am not a doctor and this is not medical advise!**

Depending on how fast your sugar is rising, and what your tolerances are, you should be fine for 2-3 hours. It is not a healthy situation to be in, but being high for a couple hours will not do that much damage unless you enter DKA or do it very often. 

If you don't have any signs of DKA, don't bother with an ambulance. They won't be able to do anything for you other than take you to a ER (they don't carry insulin on board). Watch for nausia, vomiting, shortness of breath, etc. Get home and take your insulin and you should be fine."

Called Abbott and they replaced them with a new 14 days.  Basically saved some money.  Each sensor costs me $70.00."

therealmelmel,2022-05-03,3,"I had it once before the vaccine was available and again after I was vaccinated/during Omicron. First time I was sick for a full 2 weeks and was insulin resistant for a few more days. Second time I was sick for maybe 4 or 5 days, worst of it was only 2 days, insulin resistant for 5 days."

They completely went away after my second COVID shot, which I got about two months after the onset of symptoms.

After that, blood sugar stabilized but I felt super hung over like one would feel after/during Chemo for another straight week. Lost taste and smell by day 6, regained a week after recovering. But till this day, Ive had post COVID symptoms such as Parosmia (3 months later) common/rare - and also my insulin resistance being much higher during periods and ovulation / much more than normal. It might throw your whole scale out of wack eventually like it did mine so watch out for that. Before Covid my A1C was around 6.0 and now its been so hard to manage it its been around 8.
Just make sure youre super on top of your diabetes during COVID and months after. Eat healthy too.

nevermindk9,2022-04-28,3,i see this is logged as pre-meal. the post- meal is an eaten apple icon.
DealioD,2022-04-29,2,Yeah. Thats what it is. Honestly I didnt realize there was a pre-meal or post-meal. Shows you how much I was paying attention.
BolognaSlacks,2022-04-29,3,"I use this same meter, so I'll try to make sense of it. Basically, your numbers are fine, but, you do have this marked as a test taken before eating. The meter considers 134 to be a little high as a place to start -before eating- since it will go up further after eating. 

It's nothing to be alarmed about. Just the meter's way of trying to help. =
"
DealioD,2022-04-29,2,"Ok, thank you, I was pretty sure it was pilot error, I just didnt know what the error was. I appreciate the help."
BolognaSlacks,2022-04-29,2,"Any time. If you need any further help with it, let me know."
buzzybody21,2022-04-28,2,Im confused as to what youre asking. This is a normal blood sugar after eating.
DealioD,2022-04-28,1,"Thats what I thought too. But the Control thing decided it was big and marked it as high. Thats why its yellow and not green.   
More than likely its user error, just didnt know what the error was."
seomint,2022-04-28,2,When you get a very strange reading using the finger prick test kit I was told to wash hands and try again (hands might be contaminated from some sugar source).
K5_489,2022-04-29,2,"The BG tracker I use will mark anything above 120 as a ""high"" reading, regardless of how I tag it (before/after eating, before/after sleep, fasting, etc.), though there's also an option in the settings for me to change the ""high"" and ""low"" transition points."
DealioD,2022-04-28,0,"I dont get why after I marked this as Dinner its considered high? Its lower than other readings today. This doesnt make a lot of sense to me.   
EDIT TO ADD:   
This sensor has done this to me before so I cant tell wether to go by the reader of just the reading."
friendless2,2022-04-28,4,"It is more likely a user error here.

I suspect that you hit BEFORE DINNER because there is an Apple next to the number and the color of the reading.

If you had marked this as BEFORE dinner, then you are technically out of range being over 130.  If you had actually marked this as AFTER dinner then it would have been green as it is under 180.

The usual default numbers for these types of devices are:

* Before meals: 80-130 is in range
* After meals: 80-180 is in range
* Other times: 80-140 is in range.

You may be able to set these numbers up and down a bit.

You also have to remember when using a sensor, it is 15 minutes behind what a meter would tell you if the glucose is changing (up or down) since the sensor is using interstitial fluid to calculate your glucose where the meter is using blood."
DealioD,2022-04-28,2,"Ok. Good to know, thank you! 
Honestly I wasnt really looking wether it said before or after. Obviously I will have to pay better attention."
ChronicallyIllBadAss,2022-04-28,3,Are you asking why your sugars are higher after eating? I am a little confused by the questions but if that is your question its from your body breaking down the food& It should return to normal or lower in a little bit.
DealioD,2022-04-28,1,"No. The reading is marked yellow which means high. Doesnt matter what the number is, if the reading is yellow its tossed into the high readings. 
If its good, its marked I. Green and I get credit for a good reading."
ChronicallyIllBadAss,2022-04-28,2,Oh then I am not sure that doesnt seem high to me but good luck! Hopefully you figure out
coderascal,2022-04-29,1,"What do you mean by ""get credit for a good reading""? Is someone saying things to you like ""oh you had 5 bad readings this week, not good /u/DealioD""?"

AbstracTyler,2022-05-04,3,"Yep, agreed. The way I describe the difference is like this; Type 1 is autoimmune; the immune system targets and destroys the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. For type 2s, they still produce insulin but for one reason or another their body is resistant to the effect of that insulin. Both have a genetic component.

ToffeeCoffee,2022-05-18,3,"For sugar substitute, I personally only use erythritol pretty much for coffee, tea, cooking etc. It tastes about the same as sugar and has more or less zero impact on BG. But I also have a lot handy because I bake with it. Personally though again it's the closest tasting to actual sugar for me, stevia and splenda just taste a bit off to my buds. But ymmv obviously."
southerngirlsrock,2022-05-18,1,I will look for erythritol.  But... Like at Walmart?
RookieSonOfRuss,2022-05-18,2,"Youre more than likely to see it labeled as monkfruit extract.  Its pretty common to see at grocery stores now, either with the baking supplies or where they have the specialty grains/ flours."
ToffeeCoffee,2022-05-19,2,"Monfruit and erythritol are complete different and derived from different plants, I've used both. Monkfuit is from well monkfruit, and erythritol is from corn. Erythritol is often used as a base or mix for a lot of other sweeteners though. It's fairly common now, easy to find just searching it by name."
RookieSonOfRuss,2022-05-19,1,"This is the correct take here, apparently what we got from the store was a monkfruit/ erythritol mix, not the same thing.  We made cookies with the mix and coconut flour last week that was almost as good as the real thing."
southerngirlsrock,2022-05-19,1,Thank you
ToffeeCoffee,2022-05-19,1,"Some might stock it, they have it on their online store. Or usually most health food shops will have it or just search and buy it online. Search for Erythritol, there are a lot of different sweeteners out there."

1dad1kid,2022-05-18,4,It's a good idea to check how your glucose responds to it since everyone is different. Splenda does not affect mine.
jonathanlink,2022-05-18,3,"Splenda powder is often bulked with maltodextrin, which has a high glycemic impact.

Edit: I would use the liquid version, which doesnt have maltodextrin."
Run-And_Gun,2022-05-18,3,"This.  I LOVE Splenda, but it spikes my BS(I used a LOT, usually 4-5 packets at a time per glass in restaurants and when I made tea at home 2 cups per gallon).  I switched to the liquid and it has literally been night and day with my BS.  It's expensive and I still have to use a lot, but it doesn't affect my BS."

Gruffswife,2022-05-18,2,"You could try Alulose, expensive but I find worth it. I also use liquid Splenda. I like the taste of Erythitol but it now bothers my mouth."
southerngirlsrock,2022-05-18,1,Thank you
CatFaerie,2022-05-18,1,"Chemically speaking, Splenda is almost identical to sugar. It was modified so that the body can't absorb it the way it can sugar. It's advertised as a sugar replacement and isn't supposed to have any calories or impact on your blood sugar. 

Personally, I have very little experience with Splenda because it tastes bitter to me, so I can't very if there is no impact on my blood sugar.

As far as I'm concerned, your diet is none of my business. I'm not going to offer you any criticism for it."

NonSequitorSquirrel,2022-04-27,8,"This may not be what you want to hear, but if you're having great results on Lantus, it sounds like you should stay on it. That Lantus is supplementing insulin your beta cells cannot produce. After years of insulin resistance it is not uncommon for folks with T2 to have their beta cells perish; supplemental insulin is what allows you to survive that, and thrive.

Congratulations on finding a protocol that works! I hope you stay healthy."
TXTarheel,2022-04-27,5,If the doctor thinks it is still beneficial I will stick with it.  I've lost about 15 pounds since December but really feel like it should be more due the calorie deficient diet &amp; amount of exercise I am getting.  I have read that insulin makes it harder to lose weight.  I am now (for the first time in 20 years) in the normal BMI range.
Qwesterly,2022-04-28,3,"&gt;This may not be what you want to hear, but if you're having great results on Lantus, it sounds like you should stay on it. That Lantus is supplementing insulin your beta cells cannot produce. After years of insulin resistance it is not uncommon for folks with T2 to have their beta cells perish; supplemental insulin is what allows you to survive that, and thrive.

This could be the case, yes, but it wasn't with me. My doc had me reduce 1g of carb per day in my diet until I was down to 20g/day. He told me to steer my lantus to my fasting blood sugar number, reducing it by 1 unit/day, each day that my fasting blood sugar was below 90, and to let him know if it was ever below 75 so he could approve a faster reduction in insulin.

After a month or two, I was off lantus. And at that point, I started losing weight very rapidly (15+ lbs/month), since insulin is the fat storage hormone and I was off of it.

I kept losing weight for a couple of years, lost about 300 lbs. During that weight loss, my A1C dropped to 4.9 over time and stabilized there. At that point, my doc took me off of Farxiga and Metformin, and told me I was in T2D remission and to stay on course with the low carb diet. I completed the rest of my weight loss, and am at a normal weight now. I continue to eat the low carb diet since that's the way I eat now and I like the way I feel on it."
np20412,2022-04-27,2,"In my case my insulin production is just insufficient for my insulin resistance. my C-peptide results are high, meaning my body is producting massive amounts of insulin it just ain't enough. So not necessarily that OP has low insulin production, they may just have insanely high resistance and the normal amount produced is insufficient."
NonSequitorSquirrel,2022-04-27,3,Indeed. It can go either way with T2 but it still means that supplemental insulin enables you to maintain better blood sugars.

IrregardingGrammar,2022-04-28,2,"Hey similar story here but not as long-time. Diagnosed Feb 2021 and kept a1c under 6 with diet then just kinda... Forgot/disregarded it. Was hospitalized earlier this month with like 563 blood sugar and a1c near 14. That, along with my low potassium from a medicine, almost killed me. I'm on 100 units trujeo in mornings, 20 units Humalog with meals, and 850mg metformin 2x/day but a1c is already around 9 and sugar stays between 80 and 120. Looks like I too have joined the club. If only the DKA recovery didn't make me gain 40 lbs in 2 weeks I'd feel great...."
TXTarheel,2022-04-28,1,"Wow - sounds like you progressed quickly.  My path into DKA was several years.  Being a hard head I had quit going to my primary care doctor in 2016 because her response to complaints about side effects from meds &amp; how I had to eat to sustain even a reasonable BS were met with ""its the way it has to be"".  There are so many medicines - she would not try something different.  

40 pounds in 2 weeks sounds like a lot.  Does your physician have anything to say about that &amp; how to help that rapid of a weight gain?"
IrregardingGrammar,2022-04-28,1,"My physician had no appointments available so I was pawned off on a registered nurse. She was supposed to put in 2 referrals for me, a lung xray, and a echocardiogram, and a new med. I had to message almost a week later for the med she'd forgotten and still haven't heard from anyone on the 2 referrals or 2 procedures... Not sure they were even submitted. I have started to go back down though, my theory is water retention, my new med was a water pill and I've dropped 5.8 lbs this week. During my rapid gain though there were days that I'd gain 5 or 6 over night. It's weighing on me physically though (no pun intended). Imagine being down 65 lbs and suddenly ballooning up 40 lbs that fast. Ugh."
T2d9953,2022-04-27,1,"That is excellent, but I am sure the insulin has a lot to do with it. Good luck."
dezie1224,2022-05-17,3,"That is amazing!  

I went through something similar a year ago.  BG level at 336 and A1C 11.7 and an infection that ended my up in the ER and seeing a surgeon for a while afterwards.  I ended up getting my A1C down to 7.7 about a month or so later when I finally got serious and took my metformin as prescribed and started cutting sugar out of my diet.  My biggest change was eliminating soda 100% (I went from drinking 2 or more can of Coke per day to maybe one can per week).  

I have still have a lot of work to do but its inspiring to read of stories like yours that show that things can be turned around."
CLINT-THE-GREAT,2022-05-17,3,"Coke and sweet tea were my vice. Like I drank Coke, tea and water, thats it. Thankfully CokeZero has been a Godsend. For me anyway, its 90% as good as regular Coke but really no downsides.

CLINT-THE-GREAT,2022-05-18,1,For the first couple months I just read nutritional information on everything I ate. I counted carbs and tried to keep them under 40-60 every meal. Dont waste your carb points on beverages. Eat tons of protein. Be good about taking your medicine. Try to exercise some

FBMBoomer,2022-05-17,0,I too offer congrats. Any BG over 140 causes irreversible cellular damage and makes the disease progressive.
lcdawg11,2022-05-17,3,"So I have seen this before and am genuinely curious: part of my diabetes management has been hitting the gym and exercising (I play soccer and water polo for fun). All 3 of those things put me over a 140 bg.

I'm a type 1.5 or LADA diabetic so I don't produce much insulin. Soccer and water polo can spike me to 250. What's worse? Bring sedentary or having your bg spike because of exercise.

designgeek89,2022-05-02,3,"Hey type2 here. I am sorry to hear that. I hope you get better soon. I had Covid twice. Once at the beginning of this whole thing and I had it again at the beginning of this year. Although it does suck eventually it does get better. I didnt have any energy whatsoever so I couldnt even do a work out at all. So what I did was I would force myself out of the house just to go for a socially distance walk on the running trail that is by my house. 

I would just go sometime during the mid day since it was the time where the least amount of people were on the trail. Because you are sick I am sure that you are not eating what you would normally eat.  In my case I just waited it out and eventually after I got all better from Covid the blood sugars eventually returned back to their normal levels. 

I had found a list of foods that were known to help lower blood sugar levels but because I was so sick at the time my body just was rejecting everything I ate so this was not helping. My suggestion is to just make sure you get plenty of rest and fluids and just give it time and eventually once youre all better things should go back to normal."
c1nunya,2022-05-02,2,Thank you. Im trying to eat an anti inflammatory diet to assist in my recovery. How long did your recovery take?
designgeek89,2022-05-03,1,The first time I got covid there was no vaccine out yet so I had it pretty bad for just over a month. This year when I got it because I was vaccinated and because I already had it once before it was not as bad since my body already knew what to expect and how to handle it so it only took me about a week and a half to feel better. To be honest when I had it the second time it did not feel like I had it. Just felt like a regular cold to me.
jonathanlink,2022-05-02,2,Yeah. They lingered 15-30mg/dl higher for about 2 months. And theyre still higher than I like.
c1nunya,2022-05-02,1,"Thank you. Yeah, mine are at least 30 higher than normal. Have you been able to exercise? Does your physical activity bring them down?"

Sammy_9412,2022-04-29,5,"Diabetes is chronic high blood sugars, so you have kind of the opposite happening. 

There is a condition called reactive hypoglycaemia, im not too knowledgeable about it and not at all suggesting this is something you have, only testing can tell you that but might be worth you looking into, I believe there is a sub for it, my basic understanding is a person over produces insulin after carbs and it drops their blood sugar too low. There is some overlap with this condition and T2 diabetes but it isnt the same thing. 

With testing, avoid testing too soon after eating wait 1-2 hours, otherwise you might end up seeing numbers that seem too high when in reality, your body just didnt have enough time to do its thing and bring them down. 

Otherwise just keep your metre with you and test when you dont feel right, see if it correlates with low blood glucose, if it does, make notes to see if there is a pattern. Does it occur after certain foods? exercise? etc. so you have all the info you can get to discuss with a doctor if you need to.  

Hope you get to the bottom of it and feel better soon"

If you are still unsure I would go get an other opinion and get an A1C test done."
buzzybody21,2022-04-30,1,Same. Mine was almost 900mg/dL when I was diagnosed. 96 couldnt be more normal.
myohmymiketyson,2022-04-29,1,"Home meter?

There's a margin of error on it. While 106 in a lab setting would technically be pre-diabetic, labs are much more accurate. Your meter could be 20% off.

So, I wouldn't excessively worry about an elevated fasting one time with a glucose meter at home. 

I would schedule an appointment with a doctor for a fasting and A1c, though. Tell your doctor you were moderately hypoglycemic in the hospital and you saw a slightly high fasting at home."
Not_Stupid,2022-04-29,3,"Diabetics only get low blood sugar from manually injecting too much insulin.  It's not a symptom of untreated diabetes.

pancreaticallybroke,2022-04-29,3,"Ok so you don't have diabetes as we have the opposite problem. 

See your doctor for a general check up to see if there's anything going on with you medically.

If there isn't, some people just seem to suffer with this. In terms of managing it, it's not great to be relying on fast sugar like sugar cubes or Gatorade. Before working out, you ideally need something an hour or so before that's going to take your body a bit of time to get the sugar out of it. Something like oats, rice, bread etc. Think carbs rather than sugar. If you still have issues then try sipping something sugary while you work out.

Get some glucose tablets and keep these on you to treat when you drop suddenly. However the goal should be to avoid dropping suddenly by eating regular meals at regular times of the day."
jonathanlink,2022-04-29,2,"You are not diabetic. Consuming sugars and gels for athletics is suboptimal, though. Athletes who rely on these should minimize their use to longer races and endurance events. A 5k or 10k run should be within zone 2, and would rely on stored body fat for the bulk of energy needs. I do my runs and power walks fasted or after a bit of coffee and cream, or 4 hours after eating. 

You need to up your electrolyte game from Gatorade which is just sugar water. The electrolytic effect comes from mostly sugar and not from sodium or potassium.

Edit to add: did you have a hard sprint before your most recent episode?"

I have narrow heels so it's hard for me, and I use wide width shoes then use hiking lacing techniques to reduce heel slip. I'm all about Merrell light hiking shoes.

If you have good sensation ""barefoot"" style shoes might be a good option (not ones with separate toes) but most brands have really thin soles. So if your sensation is diminished, there's a chance you could step up something &amp; not notice the bruise/injury."

Bookworm3616,2022-05-14,2,"I'm prediabetic. I'm realizing I need to talk to my doctor and counselor about medical anxiety (losing mom with her health issues I think triggered it worse for me. Moving to college was enough).

Anyways, I use the Dexcom. I tried a Libre (mom really didn't need it anymore. What were we going to do, attach it to her embalmed self?). I have already had the Dexcom I sware save my life at least once for sure (it reported in the 40s and I was driving. Scared the living daylights out of me after when I realized I wasn't meant to do that at all). 

I also collect data for my dietitian, my endocrinologist, and possibly every other doctor. Is it because of a 'diet' -maybe. Do I think it's awesome - yeah, I do. 

I was sick enough I was barely awake most of the day, had a 100.8 °F fever, and at one point was throwing up acid. Still have sore sides from it. I legit was Googling DKA again as I drank Gatorade to up eletrolights while already high from being scared to throw up Metformin - done it before. Not fun. I had my endo get antibody labs luckily before that mess. 

I think a GCM for a high risk pre-diabetic is a good idea. My autism makes intuition of the body either none existent or too much. I am almost completely hypo and hyper unaware. I have anxiety, but instead of pricking every 30 minutes at times, I can look at my phone. My doctors can get real time and live data at any point in the day basically based on what I eat. Think about that power. I was at a 6.3 or .4 when diagnosed prediabetic. I've yet to leave the pre diabetic range. I give myself about 2 years before I'm diagnosed fully. Just bad family genetics. My Dexcom currently in the meantime gives us good info to keep me safe. When I get diagnosed, I'll keep using it. I don't have the executive function for the Libre. Will it be odd - sure. But it keeps me safe. 

Basically, dietiers can take a step back. Prediabetics should be included in CGM prescribing standards."

That's part of why you trust your meter more than your sensor, because there is kind of a lag behind your blood glucose with interstitial glucose. The numbers can be kinda off if there isn't much of this fluid, or can sometimes cause sensors to fail because they're getting weird data.

jonathanlink,2022-05-21,3,"Any exercise is good. If you can do both, do both.

I minimize zones 3-4, except for 5k race days (basically any Saturday)."

20 minute walk around the block and a 10 minute more intense exercise session a day is a really good start already. If **you** are looking to shed some weight remember to check **your** eating habits and be in a calorie deficit. Moving is a good start but doesn't matter in the end if **your** weight doesn't start moving towards the direction you want it to. Every lost kilogram of weight contributes. Small steps at a time.

**Try cycling.**   


I recently lost a lot of weight(before I was diagnosed as Type 1 mind you), when I started I could barely walk for 15 minutes without straining my legs but slowly I got better and better with longer and longer exercise.

Now I'm a bit overweight still, it doesn't really show but I'm in better shape that I've ever been and my endurance is near limitless(at least it feels like that, I can walk/ride a bike +10km easily).

Brisktheaardwolf,2022-05-21,1,Mind if I ask the stamina curve for you? I recently started cycling and I get winded after like 10 minutes XD I try lighter gears but it's still hard. When did it get easier? I know it'll be different for everyone :p
Miskalculated,2022-05-22,2,"Not sure I understand the concept of stamina curve correctly but I'll try the best I can.

The area where I live is very fluctuating in elevation so originally I got winded on the first hill within minutes. My bike wasn't really good at the time as well. Right now I get winded slightly on every hill but It's in a way that I can recover as soon as I'm at the top without stopping. It's like a short spur to the top and then relaxing gliding downhill or on flat ground and I could go on and on without stopping and it feels wonderful.

For reference my weight was 148kg when I started weight loss with a stationary bicycle. I really don't recommend this to anyone but I did a 2 hour session with it every single day for a month straight. I knew that kind of exercise could be destructive to you but I fell in love with cycling as soon as I started and I felt really good even after a month. Lost 20kg after a month as well.

At that point I bought a better bike and started to go out a lot more. Depenging on how often you bike it could get easier after one month or one year. Everything is progress. For me It got easier every single day to a certain point.

I am now 105kg and recently got diagnosed with T1 so that makes my progress a bit harder but I intentionally stopped at this point because I'm happy as I am.

jerzeyguy101,2022-05-21,1,nothing wrong with doing some of both or alternate
Fair-Lab-2682,2022-05-21,2,Both will be great but I don't want to overburden myself and if burpees are more healthy I want to continue with it.
StrangerGlue,2022-05-21,3,"Burpees put more strain on your joints, and aren't really a movement you do in other parts of your life. Burpees aren't better for your health than any other more intense exercise. 

Mixing up levels of intensity is generally best for your health. So some walks at one pace, some walks where you switch paces every few minutes, some very high intensity workouts instead of walks.

For higher intensity movements, I'd prefer to do something that resembles what I might do normally, like stepping up into a stair and raising my opposite knee as high as I can."
Fair-Lab-2682,2022-05-21,1,Actually I do such exercise I walk on a fast pace then switch to jogging then back to walk so forth and so on but I found burpees to be even harder. I know walking/jogging is beneficial for diabetes but whether burpees will have same benefits or not?
StrangerGlue,2022-05-21,2,"Burpees will have the same benefit anything that gets your heart rate to the same level will. There is nothing special about burpees that make then better. 

If you like burpees, you can keep adding them in. If you don't like burpees, add in a few minutes of something that makes your heart beat as fast as burpees. (I preferred 30 seconds of ""run as fast as I can"" a couple times to burpees, or also high step ups.)

Improcement i's about your heart rate, not the burpees."
Careless_Spare1063,2022-05-21,2,you most likely wont overburden yourself! itll be hard but your body will get used to it the more you do it!!
Typical_Blonde_Witch,2022-05-21,2,"Theyre not more or less healthy. Walking does more for you in the sense of endurance and longevity, while burpees do more for the short term cardio aspect of health. 

Both are worth keeping! Even if youre not able to walk as much due to the burpees from earlier that day/week, its a great place to start :)

We all start somewhere, we all start small! Best of luck to you"
Melodic-Treacle-4920,2022-05-21,-4,Not to brag but I usually get like 15 to 20k steps
aqan,2022-05-07,10,"A1C 8.3 is not considered well controlled. If your doctor is okay with you at 8.3 and is only keeping you on 500mg Metformin, Doesnt matter if they are PCP or Endo. Personally I would change doctors. Or seek second opinion at the very least."
ClayWheelGirl,2022-05-07,1,wait its not just metformin but omepric too. some respond better to a combo than 1 medication.
aqan,2022-05-07,4,Sorry didnt read all the text but 8.3 is not good. I would definitely see an endo.
ClayWheelGirl,2022-05-07,3,"i understand. and yes u r right 8.3. is not good, but i think even OP knows that after 12 years n control.

i assumed she knows her stuff n was looking to find what others did.

im also assuming if she cannot bring down her sugars with pcp she will see an endo."
aqan,2022-05-07,3,"To that point& I switched to endo about 2 years ago. She hasnt changed any meds but she still is much more detailed that my PCP and does offer me some insights that my PCP never did. 

IMO since diabetes is going to be with us forever, eventually we will have to graduate from PCP to a specialist so why not now. It does cost me about $500 more per year on my high deductible plan but I think its well worth for me.

Edit: my PCP is a great doctor and I still see him for everything else."
ClayWheelGirl,2022-05-07,1,"I have a controversial view. I dont depend on my doctors purely. Doctors are not nutritionists so they cannot give me all the information. 

there is a lot of research happening in this field but it takes about 40 to 50 years for the research to reach doctors and thus us. Today our general attitude towards diabetes is what our parents experienced. I am a third-generation diabetic with many family members diabetic. My kid calls me an information stalker.  Ive been observing even before my diagnosis. What we dont know much about is genetic diabetes which is what i have. i notice MODY is getting way common than even 10 years ago.

i mean diabetes is bullshit. why do we even care about it. it is a symptom n not a disease. why arent we talking about insulin resistance. Why arent we following up on insulin levels. The harm has already been done by the time you are pre-diabetic. Whats the difference between pre-diabetic and diabetes. In my books really nothing. How did they come up with the numbers? Is it because they noticed as a diabetic you have more health issues than as a pre-diabetic.

it makes my blood boil because we are not going for cure just Band-Aids. We should be tracking insulin but of course thats a more expensive test. Pre-diabetes does not happen overnight. Wacko insulin Takes 10 to 15 years to turn into pre-diabetes. WTF. Its like taking Tylenol for a headache. Well yeah you need relief from headache, but if you are having constant headaches you want to know what the reason for it is. I feel metformin is just another Tylenol.

i feel diabetes exploded in the 50s or 60s. A time of exploding processed foods and poverty. There are two ways we attacked Native Americans in the US. First with biological warfareand second with flour and sugar replacing their diet. And theyve never recovered from it. Diabetes entered their lives In the middle to late 1800s.

Today we struggled through teenage and young adult years before we look at our diet. By then the dirty deed has already been done."
southerngirlsrock,2022-05-07,1,"All of this, yes. Thank you."
walkstwomoons2,2022-05-07,4,"PCP here. I went to an endocrinologist one time. That was years ago. My current doctor keeps me well balanced. I stayed balanced for 20 years without medication using diet and exercise. My levels started to raise so she put me on Metformin. I continue to be balance for another five years. My A-1 C was 5.5 to 6. Then I got Covid twice and along with that got pneumonia. My levels skyrocketed, I was very very sick. I am now on basaglar, metformin and ozempic. I am being weaed off of the basaglar as my levels come back down. I poke myself in the morning while fasting and just before dinner in the evening.

Hint: I recently found out that if I poke myself first thing in the morning instead of waiting till after my ablutions the blood sugar is lower

I believe my PCP has handled it very well. She is also my primary on my cardiology and renal issues. I do have a cardiologist and a nephrologist, but my regular doctor handles it most well."
southerngirlsrock,2022-05-07,1,"That makes me feel a little better
 Thank you"
Forward-Elephant7215,2022-05-07,2,"I'm happier seeing my GP than my endo - my endo has always been a cheerleader (in his eyes not getting worse is brilliant) but my GP has pushed me to improve my HBA1C by saying she knows I can do better and maintaining is not enough, so if you're happy with your PCP then keep seeing him!

I'm in remission now and last time I saw my endo, he said he's see me for the final time (appointment due around now) and unless I's taken a major backslide that would be me discharged from him. But my GP is still insisting on bloods every 6 months and if my A1C stays  at 5.6% or below (currently 5.3) for 2 years then we can move to annual blood tests."
ClayWheelGirl,2022-05-07,2,"mine is uncomplicated diabetes. i have a very nice dr who gives no guidance unless i ask for it. However in his defense, he knew I grew up with diabetes and knew the basics. he is always for meeting my request, but the insurance turns me down.

No I have straightforward, simple, controlled diabetes. The doctor really isnt involved in my care except to monitor. Diabetic care is in my hands. The doc just writes my prescription and order tests.

the person who has been most helpful for my diabetic care is jessie inchauspe (glucose goddess on instagram) as well as traditional medicine from many parts of the world.

My kids are my motivation so ive been good from day 1. my doc wants me to go off meds if i want to. i was thinking about it, till prednisone screwed it all up n even tho i have finished taking it my sugars are still wacko."
fintem,2022-05-07,2,"Personally, I prefer endocrinologist over PCP. My PCP had a slam bam thank you ma'm mentality - here's a pill, see you in 3 months (when bloodwork my endo did revealed that my body was no longer producing insulin). My endocrinologist is an expert on my disease, appointments are a conversation, and I know his goal is to help me achieve the best control possible."
PM_ME_YOUR_DND_SHEET,2022-05-07,2,I am T2 and being cared for by a PCP. I'm on Metformin but have a mildly restricted diet and exercise regiment provided by my dietician. I'm fairly well controlled as of late. I have another A1C test at the end of the month.
buzzybody21,2022-05-08,2,Endo. Hands down.
StrangerGlue,2022-05-07,1,"My parents (both T2) were followed mainly by PCP.

My dad's cardiologist at the high blood pressure clinic did the diagnosing and eventually had my dad switch to a CGM. Dad saw an endocrinologist only once, and she was a research endo (who saw him as a special favour to the cardiologist, who was her dad).

If we need mom's insulin type changed, her PCP will likely do it, but for everything else, we're actually working with a diabetic educator pharmacist. She's never been seen by endo at all."
buzzybody21,2022-05-15,2,I have never calibrated a meter. Ever.
38willthisdo,2022-05-15,1,"Yay! Im not alone! That said, apparently checking your meter calibration occasionally is not a bad idea (who woulda thunk...)."
buzzybody21,2022-05-15,1,You are not. I was told that modern meters dont need to be calibrated!
Run-And_Gun,2022-05-15,2,You cannot calibrate a consumer/home glucose meter.  People are confusing checking it with control solution to see if it is reading in range to the control solution.  This is NOT calibrating.
38willthisdo,2022-05-15,1,I appreciate your clarification. So what can you do if its not reading in range- is my only option to replace it? I guess thats the question Im trying to ask. The big picture Im trying to figure out is whether Ive been relying on inaccurate numbers from my glucose meter.
Run-And_Gun,2022-05-15,2,"Correct.  Presuming the test strips are fine.  Fortunately, even good meters are not expensive and one should last for several years."
fuck_you__shoresy,2022-05-15,1,"I had no idea we were supposed to do that. I only figured it out a year after I was diagnosed, but both my daily rider (lol) and my travel backup were in range."
38willthisdo,2022-05-15,1,"LOL- the things we learn after the fact! Yeah- Ive had this meter for years (and years and years)! I still cant verify this  diabetes Scooby Doo mystery until I get the new meter, but Im sure my endo must have put Dumb-sh*t in my records when I told him this new meter theory of mine."
fuck_you__shoresy,2022-05-15,2,"Hmm, not sure. I know that I personally have had higher than normal numbers after Covid, while taking allergy meds, and after my nexplanon insertion. Also when taking cold medicine or steroids. And stress of course but not just when I think Im stressed, that sneaky anxiety where Im like oh Im just busier than normal and have some stuff going on but Im coping fine and in denial =

Not sure if any of that helps you!"
38willthisdo,2022-05-15,1,Hey- I appreciate the feedback! Sometimes little bits of random info end up solving the bigger puzzles!
lyndabone,2022-05-15,2,"My Endo reminded me in January that meters need replaced every 5 years or so. If the meter reads out of range with the control solution it's time for a new meter, thankfully those are usually pretty cheap."
38willthisdo,2022-05-15,2,"Thats funny- I was looking up meter info after seeing some of the replies, and I, too, saw that info online. Well...I was doing a mental calculation and I know this meter is at LEAST 10 years old! So maybe thats the fly in the ointment with my BS numbers! New meter should be arriving this week, and Im hoping that solves my mystery."
mystisai,2022-05-14,1,"I use dexcom which has the ability to be calibrated. I use the calibration code with every sensor and have never been asked by the meter to calibrate.

Calibrating sensors does not correct the value if you calibrate it to the wrong value, which is why they come with the calibration code needed."
38willthisdo,2022-05-15,1,"Im a bit confused (I use Dexcom, too, and love it!)- are you talking about the calibration option under settings? That is what I calibrate to my glucose meter when the cgm numbers look off from my meter values (I take injections so I use my meter as the determiner of injection quantity). And, yeah- I thought my meter values were rock solid, but in light of this A1c mystery.....it is completely plausible my meter is off (what a bummer!). Edit: hang on- I know what youre referring to! Yes, I enter the code every time I start a new sensor (the 4-digit number on the sensor). Since I inject, I like to use the Dexcom more for glucose trends than the injection values (Im an old-timer). But youre right- if my meter is off, its not that helpful, huh?"
mystisai,2022-05-15,1,"Yes. If you use that setting incorrectly it will make the readings more inaccurate.

The fact is neither method is 100% accurate."
Mokulen,2022-05-13,3,"I think you can just close the app to make the alarm stop.

Also I never listen to the error suggestions. I just keep trying until it works again."
hoguemr,2022-05-13,2,I'm glad it warned me but then it did this and since the last reading it had was a low it continued to give a low alarm every 5 minutes. I finally just had to turn off my phone which is my alarm clock so that was a bit annoying too.
GrandOptimism,2022-05-13,2,"Welcome to a whole new world of frustrations.  Libres are great when they work, but prepare yourself to continue to be disappointed"
hoguemr,2022-05-13,2,I've used the Libre for years with minimal problems but I don't know about this Libre 2
imGnarly,2022-05-13,1,To me it was the opposite. I test Libre against test trips once a day. Libre 2 is way less volatile for me.
dzb9,2022-05-13,2,Call abbott and get a new sensor - they are very willing and non stingy about replacements
nevermindk9,2022-05-13,1,ffs. my new sensors take a day to settle in but i've yet to see a seven hour gap. what did your finger stick tell you?
hoguemr,2022-05-13,2,It was low. I just kept finger pricking until it was 100 then went to sleep and hoped for the best lol
reidnaa,2022-05-13,1,Ya. I use the libre 2 because of the size and whats available to me. But it sucks more than not sucks.
nrgins,2022-05-13,1,"That happens sometimes. Make sure you don't bump the sensor. Also, putting an overpatch over the sensor helps keep it in place and prevents that from happening.

Also, make sure you put the sensor over a fleshy part of your skin, and not over muscle. Abbott says that the back of the arm is the only authorized place. I found that that place, directly opposite the muscle works the best, about halfway between the shoulder and the elbow."
Swiftlock,2022-05-13,1,"Mine does this whenever my sugar is rapidly changing, but it tells me 10 minutes? No idea why yours says 7 hours thats crazy"
ImpossibleSwing1738,2022-05-13,1,Damn 7 hours???
phanesoaks,2022-05-14,1,"I figured out on libre 2 , that the steeper the change in blood sugar, the more errors it threw at me."
Young_Bu11,2022-05-14,1,"I've never had a problem with it, half the time I can't afford it though so I'm probably not a great representation."
murphytheoptimist,2022-05-15,1,"I've found Diabox more reliable than the FSL2 app. And it's easy to scan and/or reconnect the sensor when it loses connection on the rare occasion. I'm running android though, so I can't vouch for reliability for iOS."
rigiboto01,2022-05-10,4,I felt very hungry but not altered. However everyone is different. Can change based on how high your normal is for how long also. Talk to your Dr they may adjust your dose.
friendless2,2022-05-10,5,"If your glucose has been high for a long time before this, then yes 76-78 can feel awful.

After about a week of normal glucose levels and it won't feel so bad in the 70s.

Yes I feel hypo at 78, but not too bad.  Just the beginnings of it.  Which is good for me as I used to not feel it until I hit the low 60s."
Deafsnow,2022-05-10,2,My sugar levels havent hit above 150 in like 3 months

jonathanlink,2022-05-11,2,I had false lows at 150s when my a1c was 10.4.
Mongoose29037,2022-05-12,2,Mine varies. Most times I'll start getting shaky around 80 but Sunday night I didn't get shaky until 54.

PhilliPARomneySR,2022-05-11,1,Yes
jon4jay,2022-05-11,1,I feel a little off with those numbers like it's about to to down.
ChronicallyIllBadAss,2022-05-11,1,That is usually when I feel shaky and low I thought everyone did I guess not
chiefstingy,2022-05-12,1,"When I first started medication I was feeling lows around 75ish. Now that my diabetes is lot more controlled I dont ever feel lows, not even when it drops down to 45."
igotvoipenated,2022-05-12,1,"I only felt weird once when I was around 55, but 60 and up I generally feel fairly normal but maybe a little tired. I believe a lot of other people feel hypos sooner than I do though, I'm not sure why tbh.

When I'm high around 250 I will get a headache."
ComplexChica,2022-05-12,1,"I've totally felt that way when my blood sugar has been high for a while, and then adjusting back down to healthy/normal levels."

LaineValentine,2022-04-28,2,To me it feels like a lead blanket that once higher than 400 goes electric and burns through all my nerves.  My muscles get stiff and moving becomes painful. When I was first diagnosed I had highs between 300-800 regularly and was constantly in pain. I think it has something to do with the lactic acid buildup in our muscles ???
joseph4th,2022-04-28,3,I know dehydration factors in there somewhere.
Apprehensive_Ad8542,2022-04-28,1,"That sucks so bad, I'm sorry! I hadn't thought about lactic acid build up though! That's a good thought."
LaineValentine,2022-04-28,2,"It was one hell of an incentive to never be over 400 again though = just sucks because exercise can help you drop a high, but when it hurts to move you just wanna lay on the floor and scream."
qki7,2022-04-28,5,"Be careful with excercise with high blood glucose, tho. If your blood sugar is too high, you may be producing ketones and I think it's dangerous to work out under that condition since your BS may go even higher and potentially drive you into a diabetic ketoacidosis."
LaineValentine,2022-04-28,1,Oh yeah Ive never managed to convince myself to do more than walk around that high but youre right the ketones will come get you. Its a balance of drinking water and moving a little

itr110,2022-04-28,2,Ive always assumed it has to do with inflamed blood vessels. Motrin or anti inflammatories work wonders.

Might not be the cause, but now we know to keep an eye on the correlation if it happens again!"
reesecheese,2022-04-29,1,"I used to have pain in my feet and sometimes up to my knees when my sugar was high. I didn't know what it was, but then I got diagnosed and figured it out pretty quickly. It sucks to live on a strict diet but cutting out one type of pain (for me) was worth it. YMMV of course, I'm brand new to this and just learning the basics. Now that I'm more controlled I just have regular pain from the 14 other things that are wrong with my body ="
Booshmoof21aa,2022-04-30,1,For me I feel like my blood has gotten thick (literally has) and I feel the intense pain. As well as acute sensitivity in my feet and hands. I can definitely say high sugars make you feel like youve been in a really weird fight where you could do nothing and you were being beaten by a club
RogueGirl11,2022-04-30,10,"Along with diabetes, I've got depression and anxiety and a few other things because, you know, variety is the spice of life.

Absolutely love this. It also makes me want to upy planning game. =B"
lil_sebastian_1000,2022-05-01,2,"Same and we probably have anxiety and depression because of the diabetes, its a common side effect of a lot of chronic illnesses"

hellooomarc,2022-05-01,2,YES!  Anxiety and OCD played (and still do) a huge part of why I like to write stuff down and be organized.  I just don't trust myself when it comes to remembering to take meds and what I eat through out the day.
RogueGirl11,2022-05-01,1,"&gt;I just don't trust myself when it comes to remembering to take meds and what I eat through out the day.

PhilliPARomneySR,2022-05-02,3,Hey thanks ! Yes. I battle low energy moments still daily. Although it used to be bad in late mornings through late afternoon. I dont have those anymore so diet and exercise have helped a lot. I walk a lot during the middle of the day so that has helped a lot
The_Reluctant_Whale,2022-05-02,2,What were your 4 meds?
ClayWheelGirl,2022-05-02,2,"for me it was almost instantaneous. what i hadnt realized was that really high sugar was shutting me down.

i did the glycemic load of my prediabetic oatmeal. holy cow! in non diabetic world that would be a highly nutritious meal. for a diabetic - asking for trouble.

once i started my metformin, took a week to stabilize n realized i wasnt dozing off as i usually do. started IF 18/6 lost weight n brought my A1c down. 

Since then been diagnosed with sleep apnea. So waiting for my CPAP and hopefully the tiredness will improve"
Razeone,2022-05-02,1,"Thanks for the reply! Do you have any info on glycemic load I looked it up online but find it hard to know what I'm looking at. It sounds interesting and helpful. I used to not eat for 12 hours at a time from sleeping and skipping breakfast in the mornings, these days I have been a bit too weak and have been eating a bit of turkey deli meat and some cheese and a bit of fruit water sometimes lemon water in the morning to get me a bit more alert. Do you have a meal that you replaced the oatmeal with? Or did you just find a healthier oatmeal?"
ClayWheelGirl,2022-05-02,1,"i wish there was an easier way than doing math, but there isnt that i know of. https://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-the-Glycemic-Load-of-Your-Meal

when i started IF i did 18/6 n 2 meals a day. but thats my metabolism. slow n sluggish. ive eaten 2 meals most of my life.

now you may need more meals because your body might process very differently.

i would remove any processed foods from your diet. i know u said u have, but even processed meat. 

have you gotten your iron levels checked?

the key is getting to understand your body. how do you do with dairy n gluten? does meat energize you or make you tired?

btw cold with diabetes is a whole different story. it taxes your body much more. so therefore more tired.

but going back to food try different combinations n see. for bfast try an apple with peanut b. or a small oatmeal with nuts n almond milk. maybe roll a fried egg with your turkey. 

could you be depressed? im not looking for answers. just making suggestions to see what might fit.  it played havoc with me during the pandemic.

can you do fruit smoothies? almond milk n 1cup mixed berries - blackberries n raspberries being key. my recipe is 1c almond milk, 1 - 1 1/2c strawberry, blueberry, black n raspberries + 1T pb + 1 t chia seeds. measure ur blood before n after to see what impact it has on ur blood sugar. i had to buy the walmart glucometer because insurance would not cover my strips!"
Razeone,2022-05-02,1,"Thanks that's super insightful! Also thank you everyone and especially you for taking the time to reply. It actually helps so much to speak with people going through the same stuff. 

I'm definetly still getting used to what energizes me and what makes me tired as everything changed after my recent episodes. I will try those food options and at this point I'm willing to try anything. 

Yeah the cold is definetly draining. So is the change of not using marijuana but hopefully those are slowly getting better and better.

I definetly could be a little depressed but maybe just more stressed than anything with this diagnosis and new challenge but I try to take things day by day. My 2 year old is also sick with a cough and cold so it gives me some anxiety to try to balance not being able to go back to work yet and trying to keep him healthy and occupied so he can get back to daycare and not burdening my wife with too much of our life load.

I was doing fruit smoothies before but was adding banana and strawberries and realized bananas are not that great. I heard they were great for stored energy but I didn't know they were so packed with sugar. I will try the smoothie you suggested and other ideas as I love Berries and apples and am trying to learn to like eggs without ketchup.

I have a followup with my doctor on the 3rd week of May and he is going to do another blood test to see where my levels are at since starting the metamorfin regiment. I don't think he said anything about my iron levels but I will followup as I know that is related to energy levels. I am going to ask about my thyroid also while i am at it and hopefully convince him to give me a prescription for a blood glucose meter. If not I will probably just buy my own as you did. The Walmart one looks like it is a decent price. I am sorry about your insurance, I can't believe the bullshi.t I read on this forum about insurance. It seems like they are actively trying to prevent people from becoming healthy and just worsen symptoms of stress anxiety and depression with all the already sick people.

I was taking a multivitamin trying to boost my immunity the last couple days but replaced it with vitamin D and B-12 as I didn't speak with my doctor about how the vitamins worked with Metamorfin. I am sure it's safe to keep on with it and will most likely pivot back to it from everything I've read it seems perfectly safe.

Good luck with your struggles and keep up the good fight!"
ClayWheelGirl,2022-05-03,1,vitamins are all ok with metformin. what you are taking is great. we are all VERY deficient in vit A. can you also do a fish oil for omega 3s and magnesium 400mg (anything but oxide - make sure you dont buy the oxide as our body barely is able to process it.) in general the whole population is v low on magnesium.
MotherBig9171,2022-05-02,2,"Low energy is a thing for sure. I work as a waiter and the other day they brought some pizza in as a reward. I thought i was being a good pizza vampire only eating topping and a little crust. Wont do that again I was totally crashing with low energy and feeling completely out of it having to double check orders, making a mess here and there. I finally recovered an hour later after having way more Coke Zero then I usually do and running around more to wake up. I definitely wont be having pizza at work anytime soon."
Razeone,2022-05-02,1,"Thanks for the reply! That sucks I used to order out every lunch which consisted of fast food mostly. I have now cut that out completely but boy do I miss KFC, Burritos, burgers, Subway etc. I'm sure slowly but surely I will not have as hard of cravings but I thought I could coast through this with cheese and bacon and now I think I have to not eat as much of that. Thankfully I like salad so after I boost myself a bit I try to get a salad in but that can get expensive. Just ate some now and it is pill time and shower time while I have energy! What did you eat today?"
MotherBig9171,2022-05-15,1,Sorry Ive been working way too much but for breakfast I started with a base of some lettuce then low fat cottage cheese some salsa and guacamole with three eggs over easy and some cheese. So being a diabetic can still be fun eating this. I also add turkey bacon sometimes and I switch to some blue cheese with tomatoes. I know blue cheese dressing isnt for everyone but also ranch and some balsamic vinaigrette and an avocado is amazing as well.
Grossfolk,2022-05-01,2,"First, know that everyone reacts differently to things, so, whatever someone says, YMMV (your mileage may vary).  There's no substitute for using your glucose meters and test strips to tell whether something is working for you or not.  That said, I've had good results for the past 14 years following a low-carb regimen--no meds, diet and exercise, and once I got my A1c below 6, it's stayed there--last A1c, a couple of months ago, was 5.7.   

For a good introduction to Type 2:  look up Gretchen Becker's The First Year:  Type 2 Diabetes (last update: 2015).

For a good explanation of food and its effect on blood sugar (whether T1 or T2) Richard K. Bernstein's The Diabetes Solution.  Much of it can be read online, for free.  Just Google ""Bernstein Diabetes Book read online""  


Another excellent online resource for diabetes generally is Jenny Ruhl's Blood Sugar 101 (www(dot)bloodsugar101(dot)com).  She's done the research, and explains it in laypersons' terms."
MotherBig9171,2022-05-02,2,Those are great resources recommendations I will check those out!
Razeone,2022-05-01,1,Thank you for the reply and helpful resources! Congratulations on your health accomplishment! That gives me calmness and confidence in my own struggles. My doctor recommended not looking into a blood sugar tester or other tester as for right now to not overload me with info yet. I will definetly look into testers soon though as it seems like a more precise way to dial in my diet and what works for me.
jeffbell,2022-05-06,5,"A1c is a way of estimating your sugar levels over the past 90 days. 

Mg/dL is your sugar level at this instant. Higher fasting readings may be due to the dawn effect. 

Similar things but different."
flaz,2022-05-06,3,"It's not one or the other.

Fasting sugar is sort of an overall indication of pancreas and/or insulin function. If it's high, the pancreas isn't able to produce enough insulin, or the cells of your body aren't able to efficiently transport sugar into your cells. Simple as that. Your fault or not, this is an indication of how well automated your body is right now in regards to insulin production, function, and glucose transport. This is a hard number that cannot be escaped.

A1C is an average of the last few months. It can lie about whether or not you are diabetic. However, a very high A1C is certainly an indicator of diabetes. A normal A1C does not mean you are not diabetic.

It's complicated. Your doctor is the right person to talk to about this."
Sprig3,2022-05-06,1,"Hmm, I've always believed the opposite.  

A1C is a better indicator of being diabetic. 

Fasting is just one point in time.  Stubbing your toe can cause point in time BG to go up, but an A1C increase would require stubbing your toe every hour for 3 months."
flaz,2022-05-06,1,"My dad has an A1C of 5.0 (and as low as 4.7 recently), is on a Keto diet to keep his blood glucose low, but has a fasting blood glucose consistently over 125. Hmm... to me that looks like someone in denial of having type 2 diabetes. But I'm not a doctor, so what do I know?"
Sprig3,2022-05-06,1,"Yeah, elevated fasting glucose is quite common with keto diets:

[https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/fasting-blood-glucose-higher](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/fasting-blood-glucose-higher)

[https://www.nutrisense.io/blog/keto-blood-glucose](https://www.nutrisense.io/blog/keto-blood-glucose)

That in and of itself is not a sign of diabetes.  (Your dad could have insulin resistance and just be controlling it through diet and exercise, though, I couldn't say.  A (reliable) measure of fasting insulin levels would be a better measure of that, but insulin measurements are kinda tough to trust, too.)"
flaz,2022-05-06,1,"That is interesting! However, he went into the keto diet *because* his A1C was a little high, and his fasting sugar was high and his doctor said he was in danger. Now his doctor is satisfied that he's controlling his A1C with diet and is letting the fasting sugar slide. Again, I'm not a doctor, but I do know how stubborn my dad is, and to me, a fasting BG of 130 is darn suspicious, regardless of a low or normal A1C. But hey, maybe he's fine and it's just a result of keto now."
Sprig3,2022-05-06,1,"Yeah, ""diabetes"" is sort of just a symptom (high blood sugar).  

The underlying disease (different types of autoimmune attacks or different types of insulin resistance) could vary a lot.  

Most type 2's on this sub would call it ""controlling"" their diabetes or ""remission"" or something rather than being cured.  But words are whatevs.  If it keeps the A1C down, it's probably fine.  

With older folks (60+ ish?) A1C and fasting BG just rises some anyways, and it doesn't always mean it's going to get to ""diabetes-level"" (""prediabetes"" in older patients is not a good indicator of progression to diabetes: [https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2775594](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2775594) ))."
flaz,2022-05-06,1,"&gt; Most type 2's on this sub would call it ""controlling"" their diabetes or ""remission"" or something rather than being cured.  But words are whatevs.

Exactly.

&gt; If it keeps the A1C down, it's probably fine.

Agreed."
suchahotmess,2022-05-06,1,"Ive seen both as diagnostic criteria, but my understanding was that the official diagnosis is typically based on A1C. You could try spot checking throughout the day, over a couple of days, to reassure yourself."
jenana__,2022-05-06,1,"You can trust both, where HbA1c tell you a bit more about the past 2-3 months and your BG gives you a momentary insight in your BG at that certain point. It shows that your nights are pretty stable and your morning glucose is pretty acceptable (and maybe a tiny bit higher than what's considered the normal range). Your conclusion could be that apparently your current way of managing it, which is something you could discuss with your doctor. 

As far as you're talking about one or another diagnose, that should be done by a doctor (not by chart) and isn't necessarily 100% conclusive."
Rabidlamb,2022-05-06,1,"You've still a bit of Dawn Phenomenon.

Fasting is nearly always the last to go up &amp; the last to come back down. Your body needs to regain sensitivity to micro glucose changes caused by your liver dumping fat in your bloodstream.. 

It will come down based on your A1c but may take 6 months, keep it up."
vastmagick,2022-05-06,1,"I like to think of A1C and your fasting blood glucose as pieces of a puzzle.  They are both important and when they say different things that doesn't mean that one is wrong, necessarily.  That gives more information of what is going on.

People like to use the analogy that A1C is similar to an average of your blood sugar over the course of 90 days.  So here is a simplified example of how 2 of the same averages can be different: 

Case 1: the average of 1,1,1 is 1 (I'm keeping it very simple both so you don't mix them up and to keep it simple)

Case 2: the average of 1,0,2 is 1.

Case 1 and Case 2 are different situations going on but the test result would show 1 in both cases.  So if we add in a fasting test(another analogy) and get 1 or 2, we have a better idea of what case we are in.  The actual numbers are bigger and more complex because A1C isn't exactly like an average and I've only had a few sips of my coffee so far."
EddyF1208,2022-05-06,-2,"Looks like you've got measurements in the two diff scales.

myohmymiketyson,2022-04-28,3,"Metformin rarely causes hypoglycemia. Your 2-hour number is totally normal, not low. That's what a non-diabetic sees after 2 hours, so that's really excellent. 

Technically below 70 is the daaaaaanger zooooone, but it's more of a concern if you're on insulin or a med that causes lows. The reason is that 70 can mean you are about to plummet. You're not on those meds, though, so if you see yourself in that range, just have a snack. You don't need 15 grams of sugar. String cheese and some nuts will bump you up.

But in the 80s? You don't need to do anything. Your blood sugar is great."
ratbitxh6,2022-04-28,1,"Thank you! 

My issue is that once I reach that 2 hour mark, the number is great! After that I will slowly plummet into the 50s and 60s and not feel a thing until im about to pass out. I think I may have reactive hypoglycemia. Other than that im great!"
myohmymiketyson,2022-04-28,1,"Oh dear, yes, that is a problem! Reactive hypoglycemia is very possible. Are you eating protein and fat with your complex carbs?"
ratbitxh6,2022-04-28,1,"Ill be honest with you. Im extremely overweight (PCOS) and I have pretty disordered eating. For a few months I will binge (mostly junk) and then for a few months you cant convince me to eat a thing. Im currently having some mental health issues so I went to my primary care doctor and did some blood work and got some meds. I had just ate some mexican food with a big soda. I got in to the office an hour later and they did my blood work and I was on my way. 

Some time passed and I got my lab results and bs was 66!! I didnt feel a thing! My aunt said it could be reactive hypoglycemia, but this would have JUST started. I had a low blood sugar in the park about two months ago and passed out. that was from not eating. i got a monitor and would check 2 hours after eating. it was your usual college student junk food and ice cream for dinner. sugars would be 100-115 and stay that way and never drop. 

I have changed my way of eating. Ive cut out sugars and im trying to eat high protein, fat, and carbs. Nothing will stick. Because of this ive been at a loss. Sorry for the long explanation!"
Mongoose29037,2022-04-27,2,"Metformin is long acting, but if you take it at night there's a chance your BS could end up crashing after several hours. So, check w/ your doctor &amp; voice your concerns about it."
in_the_sheyd,2022-04-27,2,Metformin doesnt cause low blood sugar and if you have reactive hypoglycemia which is what you seem to be describing itll help prevent the blood sugar spikes that are triggering it. Your doctor knows their stuff.
ratbitxh6,2022-04-28,1,"My issue is that i never have a spike! I will eat a decent meal and my sugar will get to about 120, and then go right back down to the 80s. Right after that I crash."
in_the_sheyd,2022-04-28,2,It's less important how high the blood glucose gets in any absolute measure and more important that it's going up rapidly which can trigger reactive hypoglycemia. In any case metformin will help by reducing the amount of glucose your liver will be releasing into your blood at mealtimes. It'll make that rise time slower which should help at least a little bit.
ratbitxh6,2022-04-28,1,thank you!
friendless2,2022-04-27,1,"Prediabetic Type 2 can have crashes when glucose levels are elevated for long periods of time, and the functioning pancreas produces too much insulin, that isn't being used due to the insulin resistance.

The trigger happens to get the body to process the insulin, and this causes the crash (hypoglycemia)

Preventing elevated glucose levels should reduce the hypoglycemic events by reducing carb intake, taking medication, drinking water and exercising."
ratbitxh6,2022-04-28,1,Ive completely cut out sugar. Without eating carbs I crash even more. Im not sure what else to do!
friendless2,2022-04-28,1,Talk to your doctor about the hypoglycemia.
AbstracTyler,2022-05-25,6,"I think you'll find that the vast majority of the people who have used both Medtronic and Tandem insulin pumps will prefer Tandem. I am in that camp, personally. I used Medtronic for more than 15 years. I recently switched to Tandem and the difference is huge. It's a gulf between the two. The Dexcom sensor is way more accurate than the Medtronic one, and insertion is much MUCH kinder with Dexcom than the savage insertions of Medtronic's sensor. The choice for me is obvious; Tandem and Dexcom."

Tcourt1099,2022-05-25,3,"Went from Medtronic for over 10 years, switched over to the tandem with the dexcom and its life changing. On the medtronic you spend more time trying to stay in auto mode then auto mode does good for you. Control IQ needs nothing to work flawlessly other than changing your sensor every 10 days. I dont even calibrate and it is still very very accurate. No complaints at all so far."
Intelligent_Rain4890,2022-05-25,3,"I left my 670g for the Tandem and will never ever go back. Like everything in life there are drawbacks with both systems, but I prefer to deal with the few that tandem has vs that stupid guardian sensor. I actually switched sensors before my warrantee was up because I couldn't handle the bruises/rashes from the guardian anymore. I haven't had to calibrate in weeks. It is the best thing ever to not be screamed at every few hours because the sensor is too dumb to function in the way it was intended to."
fixerdrew02,2022-05-25,2,"I did the same thing you did then. I was having horrible reactions to guardian, ditched my newer 670 for my older medtronic and have been using dexcom until my warranty ran out. Ive been with medtronic for 20 years and finally saying good bye"
Intelligent_Rain4890,2022-05-25,3,"Tandem paired with dexcom is great. There are some drawbacks. It's more complicated to fill than the minimed pumps are. It can be a bit wasteful with insulin as well. Simply because it's not always super accurate with how much insulin is in the pouch and will tell you that you are empty but still have 30 units left. Unlike with minimed it's not possible to visualize how much is left without drawing it back out. I both love and hate that it is rechargable, depending on what situation I'm in. But the control IQ system manages my blood sugars well and took my A1c down by a full point in a couple months."

ImpossibleHandle4,2022-05-26,1,"When I first went with tandem, it didnt integrate with the dexcom. Mine died in Alaska due to a vibration motor error. Since they couldnt get me a replacement, I used the syringe that came to fill their reservoirs to give myself shots of fast acting, because in Alaska you cant get ANY insulin without an RX. I also was told by the pharmacy that you cant get syringes without an rx as well. It turned me off of the tandem hard enough that I went with the 670 and gave up my dexcom. It was literally the worst decision I have made. (I secretly pray for my company to switch insurance to swap out the demon device so I can go back to the now normal tandem pump. (Ive had this Minimed replaced twice. Once for a faulty ring in the newer ring (670 issues and once was a (770 upgraded) failure due to continued component error alarms.

friendless2,2022-05-02,3,"There are several factors at play here.  First off the medication isn't going drop glucose levels immediately.  Metformin is not insulin.  The medication is supposed to help with the insulin resistance.

Insulin resistance needs additional help to be overcome besides just medicine.  Reducing glucose levels helps reduce insulin resistance.  Usually this is managed a few ways:  Increased water intake (helps eliminate glucose through urine), increased exercise (walking is all that is needed, can help encourage the body to use the insulin) and reduction of carbohydrates consumed (don't add in more work for the body that already has a lot to do).

Elevated glucose will make you feel tired.  Getting it into normal range will help with that.

1. Take your medication as prescribed.
2. Change all liquids consumed to be little to no carbohydrates (water, diet soda, black tea/coffee)
3. Reduce food carbohydrates to a significantly lower amount.  If you are eating normally, try reducing carbs to &lt; 40g per meal.  If you are eating low carb, try Keto.  Reduce or avoid bread, potatoes, rice, tortillas, chips, desserts, fruit, sugar, oatmeal, cereal...
4. Increase activity.  Try a 30 minute walk after each meal.

Watch for DKA, where the weakness becomes extreme, with nausea, and possible vomiting everything.  This requires medical attention."

my endo has told me i am on the max gliclizade and won't put me on insulin due to the fact i had my c-peptide checked recently and i am making a lot of insulin already which i cannot argue with my endo about and which i am happy that i am still making a significant amount of insulin but unfortunately my levels aren't controlled or consistent."
friendless2,2022-05-03,1,"Look at packages, they will have a serving size, and the total carbohydrates for that serving.

If you serve yourself that size of a serving, add up the carbohydrates and you will have a total.

Example:  Bread serving size is 1 slice for 24g carbohydrates.  So 2 slices of bread would be 48g.  You see why I suggested to reduce/avoid bread in that list, I should have also included pasta as something to reduce or avoid.

Most things purchased in a store has these types of labels.  It is a matter of estimating how much you are taking for a serving and adding up the carbohydrates.

You can check out the r/keto subreddit for ultra low carb eating.  They will encourage you to stick with vegetables, meat and other low carb food.  Salad can be good, but some dressings can be full of carbohydrates.

You may not want to go full keto, just reduce carbohydrates from where they are now.  Try adding up the carbs you eat in a day, see if you can reduce it by some amount and see how the glucose numbers improve."
RightTangerine3332,2022-05-03,1,"\- i have zero clue on carbohydrate nor my dsn or endo told me about it, or how much to have or how much is to much or how much is good. nobody told me to eliminate carbs or moderate them. just told me to exercise and take my medication on time. which i don't think was bad advice, but even today 8 years on, my endo or dsn never tellls me to cut out the food i eat, i write down the foods/snacks i eat and they tell me to do more exercise and try lose weight btw i am only 5'5 on a good day and weigh 70kg, i don't need to lose weight drastically maybe another kilo or 2. anyway i am following the keto group and learning about it. and i do think it is something i may have to give a try otherwise i will just be told to exercise and lose weight by my DSN."
4thshift,2022-05-02,3,"How is it you know you are Type 2? And not some other cause?

Drink plenty of fluid and cut out the starches and sugars from your diet; at least till you get back down toward normal. 

DKA or not, you can still end up in hospital with severe dehydration  hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome. 

29 is like over 500 mg/dL. It cannot stay there for long. You definitely need to pester your health care system for some attention  can the Diabetes team at least do telehealth? Is there an urgent care that you can go to, or call and ask if they can advise you? Say you are feeling very ill and no one is helping you."
RightTangerine3332,2022-05-02,2,I have had my C-peptide checked twice and both times it has come back indicating and clear diagnosis for T2 according to my endo and  i have been diabetic since 2014. - I have been drinking plenty of water throughout the day. and peeing a lot i have got it down to 14mmol and in the morning it is around 16mmol. Personally i feel like my DSN doesn't care. my Endo who i see every 6 month and for about 30 minutes and i will see him in September now.
faroll2,2022-05-02,1,"Those numbers are pretty high, check to see if your ketones are okay, otherwise you run the risk of DKA.

I personally wouldn't feel comfortable sitting at home with those numbers. In fact, I'd check into the hospital. Normal blood sugar range is considered to be around 4-7 mmol for your information."
RightTangerine3332,2022-05-02,1,"I am type 2. my Endo told me i don't need to check for ketones. - as far as going hospital, i have been several times and i never got any help from hospital for my diabetes. its the same hospital and the same department and never get it down to normal levels which is why i avoid hospitals. - my DSN and my ENDO have seen me this year already but my DSN hasn't responded back to me in last 2 weeks."
faroll2,2022-05-02,3,"Sorry to hear that. They don't sound very helpful do they? 

I think you need to try another hospital. Your meds don't seem to be doing the job either. You would probably benefit from short term insulin. Levels of 15-29 mmol is not healthy at all, period."
RightTangerine3332,2022-05-03,1,"My first 2 years i was on insulin, i was taken off it and put on metformin and ever since my endo have done some more tests and has found that i don't need any insulin since my body is producing a lot."
faroll2,2022-05-03,1,"Your body is producing a lot, but it looks like you have a lot of insulin resistance as well, which is why your levels are very high. The question is, are they able to bring those levels down without insulin? It doesn't look like it so far. I wish you the best at finding something that works, and works quick."
ValkyrieSword,2022-05-25,6,Yes. I know someone who developed gastrointestinal symptoms so bad that they thought they had C.diff. And it was a long time after starting it
gordonv,2022-05-25,2,"In the beginning, I was able to get my sugars down from ~300 to 99. Weight down from 195 pounds to 169.  
  
But now, weight back at 192. Sugars are 140. And I ""feel full"" all the time.  
  
I think it may have to do with the pancreas and making digestive bacteria. I know metformin is actually 3 drugs. One that tells the pancreas to produce more insulin. But I think maybe my body has become resistant to that, or is acting weirdly."
ValkyrieSword,2022-05-25,2,definitely seems like a switch could be beneficial
sheerqueer,2022-05-25,2,My doctors said it stops working after a while
gordonv,2022-05-25,2,it = metformin?
marleymo,2022-05-25,1,"Ugh, it never occurred to me that I might get side effects later.  I thought I was having unusually timed period cramps but just realized today that maybe I dont know the difference between those and stomach cramps."
Maerty87,2022-05-25,4,"Yeah, thats something that happened to me, too. But it was not eight months later. It was almost two years later. 
I changed my job and moved in with my girlfriend who cooks way more healthier. I went from a position with many work-hours and much walking around (a security guard) to working in an office. 
My doctor said, that maybe this massive reduction in physical activity, the changed diet and the more scheduled meals could be the reason why my blood-sugar got derailed. 

After a year I am still struggling to get my long-time blood sugar levels down. Last time I checked it was at 6.7. 

So yeah& if youre having side effects I recommend asking yourself if there were some fundamental changes in your lifestyle and eating habits."
marleymo,2022-05-25,1,"Wow, I wonder how much of that had to do with switching to an office job. It does sound like you had a perfect storm of changes all at once."
walkstwomoons2,2022-05-25,3,Diarrhea
quiet-nurse,2022-05-26,2,I had that bad until I got my doctor to approve the extended release version of Metformin.
choodudetoo,2022-05-25,2,"Yes, I've seen posts on other social media with folks in your situation."
Rad2323,2022-05-25,2,"Yes, it started giving me side effects about 6 months later. I switched to ER but it didn't help and my sugars went up a little on ER so I switched back to IR. It's gotten better though and I did start adding Extra Virgin olive oil to my meals. I guess maybe that helped."
marleymo,2022-05-25,1,Delayed side effects just seem unfair. I'm glad to hear it goes away. I am going to be more careful about taking it with food and not doubling up when I forget to take it.

upvotes_distributor,2022-05-26,1,"Me. Mine started I think 3 months in. All was good in the beginning =C I take the extended/slow release now, no problem so far"
HollingB,2022-05-24,3,Id correct it. And get up and move around.
NnQM5,2022-05-24,2,"Thanks, i did exactly that and it seems more stable. Do you think Ive just shot in the same injection area too many times and its not absorbing? Because I switch around but my stomach is used a lot for shots"
friendless2,2022-05-24,1,"Too many shots in the same place can build up fat pockets that can slow absorption of insulin.

Rotating the sites of injections will help prevent this from happening.  Upper right, lower left, lower right, upper left, love handles left and right, etc."
NnQM5,2022-05-24,1,"Ill work on this fs, thank you:)"
KokoPuff12,2022-05-24,2,"An hour ago, it looks like you were already headed up before the injection and the potatoes. Id be curious what was happening prior to that. There was definitely an insulin deficit ahead.  The easiest assumption is that basal is too light. That will make it even harder for boluses to work."
NnQM5,2022-05-25,2,Oh wow I actually just remembered I went a couple of units lighter on the basal last night = I normally dont but I was worried about waking up low as I have been lately. I have to talk to my endo about it fs
EatABigCookie,2022-05-25,2,If you took insulin an hour ago.... I personally would not correct this; or if I did it would be a very small prudent amount. You've likely still get insulin in your system that hasn't kicked in yet.  Give it a few hours then correct if still this high. My rule is be extra careful correcting when you've still got insulin onboard that hasn't kicked in fully yet. All of my worst lows have been because I overcorrected.
NnQM5,2022-05-25,2,"Thank you, unfortunately after it came down it came back up again and Im in the same situation AGAIN this exact moment but Im gonna wait longer this time to let the insulin settle and kick in."
Th4n4n,2022-05-25,2,"General rule for type 1 is to correct every 2 hours (insulin can continue working for like 5 hours, but is strongest in the first 2). I usually correct if I'm trending up after an hour and a half."
Best-Analyst2187,2022-05-25,1,"Dont correct now.  You most likely still have INSULIN ON BOARD.  If you use for instance novolog that can take around 2 hours to fully work.  So I would wait whatever that period is of the insulin you take, then recorrect then if needed."
NnQM5,2022-05-25,1,"I did correct =, and you were right I dropped afterward, but now I know for next time. I just hate having it spike in the first place. I probably will start doing it 20-30 minutes before eating because Im planning my meals rn."
AeroNoob333,2022-05-25,1,Id wait one more 1 hour (so 2 hours total) before shooting again. Id go for a walk or do a bunch of air squats right now instead. Did you count the carbs and use your regular IC ration and correction factor?
NnQM5,2022-05-25,1,"Not sure what IC ration and correction factor are, but I did count my carbohydrates and correct based on my regimen I worked out with my doctor, which normally works pretty well."
h3llolovely,2022-05-25,1,Go with sweet potatoes / yams instead. Sweet potatoes have fewer carbs than most other potatoes.
NnQM5,2022-05-25,1,Well Im trying to bulk up so I need the extra carbs = but Ill definitely take that into account when I start cutting down
Embalmer1974,2022-05-19,8,"I feel ya there. woke up, had a cup of coffee and 200. fuckin ignorant pancreas"

NonSequitorSquirrel,2022-05-19,6,Commenting to add that straight line spike upwards happened AFTER I took a bolus and increased my basal. Didn't have a carby by dinner. Haven't eaten since 730 PM last night. FML.

NonSequitorSquirrel,2022-05-20,1,=== Maybe I dreamt of pie.
friendless2,2022-05-19,1,This is why I take Novolin N at night before bed.  The peak hits in the morning and keeps this more under control.
NonSequitorSquirrel,2022-05-19,2,"Yeah this isn't a regular occurance. I have a pump, so if it were I'd just change my basal schedule to cover it, and if I have a big dinner that's usually what I do. But this one came outta left field."
Sufficient-Ad6637,2022-05-19,1,Mine has a tendancy to go up after I take the long acting for a bit.
mbrockelman16,2022-05-20,1,No longer hav3 to deal with that bs now that I have a pump.
NonSequitorSquirrel,2022-05-20,1,I have a pump but it still happens.
Positive_Let_5203,2022-05-20,1,Thought it was some kind of crypto currency or something. Big yikes.
AKJangly,2022-05-20,1,"I just realized today that my night time basal rate directly influences whether or not I get Dawn phenomenon.

Too much basal insulin keeps me a little too low for comfort, and then I crash as soon as I get up.

Not enough basal insulin and my blood sugar does... That.

I theorize that the amount of insulin required to treat Dawn phenomenon should be added directly into the night time basal injection as long acting.

I've been dealing with this for two years, and eliminating random high blood sugar events such as Dawn phenomenon is top priority for me. Keep those random highs at bay, cut the carbs down to 50 or less, and get Android APS with Omnipod DASH.

^ that's my six month goal starting now. Sorry to hijack this thread lol."
NonSequitorSquirrel,2022-05-20,1,"Lol no worries. My problem is my DP is correlated to either how much I've had for dinner (easy to solve and I can get ahead of it before I go to bed with an adjusted basal) or how much my brain decides to be stressed about the next day while I'm sleeping (impossible to solve because I have no idea what's coming). That morning I guess was the latter which is odd because I didn't think I was stressed when I went to bed but woke up high and with a bit of jaw pain which usually means I was grinding my teeth in my sleep.

At least I have a night guard == My sugars might be a mess but my teeth were OK."

corporateballerina,2022-05-21,7,"Its still not *great,* but [Simply Orange Light](https://www.drinksimplybeverages.com/products/light-juices/light-pulp-free-orange-juice) has half the sugar of normal orange juice, and its still made from oranges.

KingWezz,2022-05-21,5,Water with a splash of oj may help the cravings.
WorfsFlamingAnus,2022-05-21,5,Buy some naval oranges and squeeze some juice- like 1/4c. Maybe having a very small amount of very high quality OJ would be good?
MentallyPsycho,2022-05-21,3,Maybe if she just measures a small amount out and has that it'll hit her craving without skyrocketing her sugars?

Rockitnonstop,2022-05-21,2,"SunRype has a 10 Calorie Tropical Mango juice. That might be close. Crystal light also makes a tangerine flavoured drink but it tastes more like orange drink rather than juice. 

You could always try watering it down a lot. If you can freeze some into ice cubes, she could suck on one to get a longer experience than drinking it."
shaylahbaylaboo,2022-05-23,2,"I would get something like an orange flavored diet soda. Orangina is like a watered down orange juice soda, no clue how many carbs.

in_the_sheyd,2022-05-22,1,"First things first, she should check her blood glucose when she gets cravings for sugary foods such as juice. Carbohydrate cravings are sometimes a symptom of high blood glucose.

Having said that as long as her blood sugars go down again after eating its not necessarily dangerous to go high from time to time as long as youre not making a big habit of it and doing it every day or on the regular. A small glass of orange juice isnt strychnine for diabetics its just not the best thing for us and the decision to say screw it and do something we know will result in hyperglycemia once in a blue moon is a calculated risk.

Oh& and depending on how advanced her disease is and depending on the tools she has at her disposal she could drink the OJ and maintain glycemic control. There are ways and means."

crimsonscyes,2022-05-15,3,If you call your insurance company I'm sure they'll refer you to one that's in-network in your area. That's how I found a endo.
Sensitive-Win-8151,2022-05-15,1,Got it! Curious did you find your dietitian by endo's referral?
KokoPuff12,2022-05-15,2,My endos office had one. I could choose to meet with her or a CDE before seeing the doctor or I could come in to see one or the other in between doctors appointments. The doctors office also had classes for newly diagnosed patients.
Sensitive-Win-8151,2022-05-15,1,Thanks a lot for sharing - wondering whether the dietitian visits or CDE are covered by insurance in your case? Also are these classes free?
KokoPuff12,2022-05-15,2,"It was all free or paid by insurance. Honestly, endos offices are usually really good at getting things paid for, if theres any way to get it covered. They seem to be experts at writing letters of medical necessity for their patients. And, being that the care is preventative, it is often 100% covered, because it can save the insurance company money in the long run."
Sensitive-Win-8151,2022-05-15,0,"Yeah that makes a lot of sense, endo can reimburse more money from the insurance company this way. So you do need the doctor's referral to see the dietitians, right? Also curious: are your endo and dietitian private practice or in a big hospital system?"
KokoPuff12,2022-05-15,1,"My first referral for diabetes ed came from a PCP at a local clinic. My others were at clinics associated with bigger systems. The doctors basically prescribed the level of appointment they thought was best on my checkout sheet. But, I could also ask if I wanted an extra appointment with one of the educators."
Sensitive-Win-8151,2022-05-15,0,"Gotcha. These doctors sound so savvy haha. Wondering approximately how many dietitian visits are entirely covered in your case? And how many those classes did you attend? Feel all those services are pretty valuable and worth the time, do you think so?"
KokoPuff12,2022-05-15,1,"It really depends on the patients motivation. If the patient wants to learn, they can get a lot out of the education. I have excellent insurance and it seems I could go four+ times a year without problem. I can also call or email the office with any questions. In my original education, we even had cooking classes."
Sensitive-Win-8151,2022-05-15,0,"Yeah agreed, the patients' motivation and attitude are the key.

Nice 4+ times are a lot! cooking classes sound very helpful. I  saw there is one dietitian even offering to help you make grocery selections. Have you tried something like that before?"
buzzybody21,2022-05-15,1,"The problem is, insurance typically only covers visits to an RD with their confines. I know for me, my a1c had to be above 8, and I had to be considered non-compliant&in my experience, insurance is more oft to cover a visit (and I mean a visit) with an RD with a type 2 vs. a type 1 (which is disgusting in my opinion, but I digress). Youll have to ask your insurance what your benefits are. Some cover an RD visit, some dont; which will be $100+/visit."
PM_ME_YOUR_DND_SHEET,2022-05-15,1,"My doctor referred me to mine, but I also found out that some of the personal trainers at the gym I go to are dieticians. I don't think I'd use them over my dietician, because the one I see also helps with diabetes education. The pt dieticians definitely know their stuff, mine just feels more specialized."
groundhog5886,2022-05-15,1,"You need a diabetic educator. Check your local hospital or health provider for department that provides overall education, to include diet, excercise, lifestyle. These have special RN's and dietitians They can provide total plan for managing diabetes."
Sensitive-Win-8151,2022-05-16,1,Thanks for your advice! Do you know whether a doctor's referral is needed to get these services covered by insurance?
groundhog5886,2022-05-16,1,That depends on your insurance. If you are on PPO type plan you should not need referral. Your doctor should have referred you by default upon diagnosis.
sallygeorgia,2022-05-15,3,No discount that I know of. The dexcom is also super expensive for me.
buzzybody21,2022-05-15,2,Agreed. Even with insurance its $$$$$$ for me. I think the libre is the cheaper option.
CatFaerie,2022-05-15,2,Freestyle Libre is more affordable than dexcom. You may be able to pay for that out of pocket for less than this.
rsmutus,2022-05-15,0,"Yeah I had that first, changed insurance companies and it wasnt covered anymore. Went to go pick it up from the pharmacy one day and they wanted to charge $1500. So now I have a useless reader lol"

KokoPuff12,2022-05-02,3,Many people find that Lantus works better as a split dose. Some even make the split uneven because they notice they need more of it in one segment of the day than the other.
thejadsel,2022-05-02,1,"Yep. I was actually initially told to take it with breakfast, but with the length of action it was wearing off at exactly the wrong time. Kept getting up high, and spiking like crazy as soon as I ate anything. Thankfully, I did find out here that you can indeed move the dose timing and/or split it, and taking more in the evening fixed the situation.

It should be fine to take at whatever time of day works best for you, as long as you're consistent with it. OP, if you want to try moving the whole dose to the evening?

I also love ""Levantine Cuisine"" (not sure if the founders of the restaurants I go to are Lebanese though.   Example:  ""Pita Inn"" in NW Burbs of Chicago)"
JellyfishLimp9083,2022-04-27,1,"I haven't eaten or tried Mexican food since I live in London, UK. What does the Mexican side of food look like?"
burnitdwn,2022-04-28,1,"It can be dangerous since there's usually lots of carbs involved,  but,  its quite robust on flavor and spice.  (and being careful, you can mitigate or reduce a lot of the threat of the carbs.)   Heat levels can be comparable to Thai, Pakistani, or South Indian style foods, but they aren't big on curries.   

They have a lot of Spanish influence in their cooking,  stuff like Chorizo &amp; Spanish Rice is very common.  It shares quite a bit in common with Filipino food as well, but I'm not sure if that is a useful reference for you.

Corn tortillas are extremely popular,  lots of lime is used to flavor food,  Cilantro and onions are used a bunch.   Avocados are delicious when made into Guacamole,  or when added to lots of different foods.

Lots of people in the USA immigrated from Mexico and brought recipes with them.  Lots of Produce sold in the USA is imported from Mexico (honestly, from all over Latin America),  so we have access to stuff that may not otherwise grow locally.  That said, much like India and most other places in the world,  every town, village, city, region, and even family has their own recipes and traditions.  The most common Mexican food in the USA tends to be ""tex mex"" style street food type (short order, quick to prepare, limited ingredients.)  However, there are a number of Grocers and more specialty type restaurants available to visit in pretty much every big City of the USA.    

I dunno, I'm a little bit too obsessed with food I think.  Probably how I got so heavy in the first place :)   

Since you mentioned you are from London, I will share some sadness.  My favorite gastropub closed due to COVID19.  If I want fish and chips, i only have 1 option within a couple miles of home,  and it's not particularly good.    


On the plus side,  broiled Swordfish is easy to prepare, and has no carbs. Salmon is easy to prepare and also has no carbs.    And we switched from eating chips (or as I would call them Fries) to eating more greens.

Sorry for long wall of text and for assaulting your language with all my Americanisms."
JellyfishLimp9083,2022-04-28,2,"Thanks, there is a big fish market in London which opens from 3am to 6am serving the freshest fish to restaurants as well as to the public, I'll be going there soon to get fish because the fish and chips shops here don't think they use particularly fresh fish, you never know so I prefer always to get my own fish. 

The seaside tho has one of the best fish, I am from Iraq and our national dish is called Masgouf, fish grilled and spiced in such a way that you'll forget anything else whilst eating it, quite an experience. The say you should eat fish twice a week maximum due to Mercury levels present in them. In Islam, we are not allowed to eat fish which does not have scales since scales in fish is used as a filtration system to clean and those fishes also don't eat dirty things.

I lost around 40lbs maybe 2 years ago and that was when I cut down my carbs and started cycling, it melted all away in a matter of 3 months, most people were shocked when they saw me having lost this much weight. I think cutting down carbs plus movement is a solid protocol to loosing weight.

I tried making Guacamole but don't think I am getting it right! I'll explore some of those foods you have mentioned, I am always intruuged how other cultures eat because to me food is medicine and sometimes when I find dishes from other countries that make me feel good and healthy then I tend to implement them right away, kind of trying to make a ""home menu"" at the moment which makes choosing what to eat healthy much simpler."
burnitdwn,2022-04-28,2,"We usually get frozen seafood at the grocers near where I live.  Most of the restaurants use frozen seafood as well.  It is possible to get fresh seafood, but only if its flown in on a plane since I am far from the sea.

I have not had the privilege of eating Masgouf before.  I think the closest thing I have had is probably blackened catfish,  but i imagine the spices would be quite a different experience for sure!

Otherwise, we can get fresh fish from Lake Michigan and other lakes local to my area.

I am familiar with Halal foods/dietary restrictions.  I have friends who i met over a long career in IT who are practicing Muslims.  

I admit, I just buy the pre-packaged Guacamole usually,  but have tried making it a few times with Avocado, Tomato, Onion, Lime, Garlic, Cilantro, Salt, and Chillies (Habanero is my favorite family of Chile, but for my wife, I would use Jalapeno since it is much milder and she doesn't tolerate as much heat.)

I agree 100% with your sentiment about food from other cultures!  There is so much history and love that goes into the food!

Hope you and your loved ones have a peaceful and happy Ramadan."

Demorandir,2022-04-28,4,"Someone please correct me if im wrong (I am quite newly diagnosed myself) but I think you should be ok so long as your are injecting the basal insulin at roughly the same time each day. As it is slow acting it has a smaller effect on lowering your BG on the short term, but does so over a much longer period than your bolus. That being said if you are concerned do a blood stick test and  as always reach out to your diabetes consultant."
Interesting-Walrus23,2022-04-28,10,Long acting insulin shouldnt have a significant impact on brining your blood sugar down. It acts as background insulin and is slowly released over a period of time vs rapid acting

Youll be fine. :)"
maii1247,2022-04-28,1,Thankyou for replying! Sorry if this sounds silly but I just started a couple days back and couldnt figure out if it was safe to have dinner and bolus for it at the same time i inject my long acting insulin. Or i should be spacing them apart? If it matters at all?
WhiteDiscussion,2022-04-28,2,The most important factor for the Levemir is to take it same time(ish) everyday; not what you're eating or how much you're eating.
maii1247,2022-04-28,0,"I know (: ive been a long time lurker on this subreddit and a t1d for 11 years. The doctors just had me on premixed insulin before and it took years of requesting before rhey switched me to the basal bolus regimen. While i do take my Levemir at the same time every night, i have no clue if itd be safe to have my dinner and inject my bolus at the same time i take my long acting or should i be spacing my dinner bolus and nightly Levemir doses apart? I just dont want their curves to overlap because levemir does start to drop me a lot 3 hours into injecting it"
WhiteDiscussion,2022-04-28,1,"Ah, I understand the concern about overlapping the ""peaks,"" especially if you were on a mix before, so the peaks were always set in relation to each other. If you are taking them right on top of each other, I guess you have a little less wiggle room if you overcount carbs and take too much bolus, but that's by a unit or two, not a precipitous crash while you're asleep."
G-ShortWarning,2022-04-28,1,"I take my morning levemir and bolus at the same time and sometimes my evening one as well. As far as I know it shouldnt make any difference. 

If you are dropping 3 hours after taking your levemir (assuming you havent bolused within 4 hours of this point) it suggests your levemir dose may be a little high. Might be worth speaking to your endo about it."
blazblu82,2022-04-28,1,"Long acting is designed to release slowly throughout the day. Basically, it's there to soften spikes. Your short acting is to deal with post meal spikes or other sudden spikes with your blood sugar."
4thshift,2022-04-29,1,"Basal takes about 4 hours to get to full strength, doesnt it? If you are not eating, you may need less. But if you are basal testing your normal dose, then you just have to monitor to see what happens. Basal is slow and catching a low and fixing with a little glucose should be no big deal, unless you are taking way too much."
maii1247,2022-04-29,2,"I did notice it starts working after 3 hours for me however it keeps dropping my blood sugar by 20 to 30 mg/dl every hour and i went into a hypo twice during the night according to my CGM and had to keep eating to bring it up. Im guessing that means i have to lower my basal right? Cause its supposed to keep ur numbers steady and not drop you every 3,4 hours?"
4thshift,2022-04-29,1,"Yes, probably so. With basal, ideally you would be fasting and drop to the 80s and if it were just enough it would hover there and never dip below 75.

If you are in the habit of eating throughout each day, it is possible to take a little extra basal to compensate for some of the food, and then need a little less rapid; but again, ideally, you wouldnt be going low, or spiking high for too long. Easier said than done. 

Depending on your brand of basal, you might have more even coverage if you split the basal insulin  seems most people who use Levemir find this to be true: One daytime dose and one nighttime dose as the first one starts to wear off. But if you were using Tresiba brand of basal, then you probably would not need more than one shot per day, because it is longer lasting. As others say, ask your doctors about this if you think your insulin is too much after taking it and then not enough toward the end of the day. 

I am not good with scheduling doses, and have a random sleep-work schedule; so I bought a Timesulin pen cap to help me realize how much time has gone by between doses. Kind of expensive as it comes from the UK, but helps me a lot with split dosing. This is the Levemir cap, I think.

melancholalia,2022-04-25,2,"same here  for my two morning cups of coffee ill bolus for about 10 carbs, even though i take it with just a splash of cream. i find that nearly always prevents the small spike. but even if i forget to do that, ill only go up to around 140 and then control iq brings it down."
mystisai,2022-04-25,1,"Caffeine can absolutely have an effect. The effect varies individual to individual and can also vary greatly on your personal tolerance. 

I drink tea constantly and have a high caffeine tolerance. Since before my diagnosis. So caffeine doesn't have an affect on my blood sugar."
Jahjahsgirl0808,2022-04-25,0,Caffeine has no effect on my blood sugars or causes me to have insulin resistance. I drink Diet Coke and energy drinks daily.
Littytiddybiddy,2022-04-25,1,ah okay. Thanks for your reply. It could be that it affects us differently or something else entirely. Gonna keep researching.
AeroNoob333,2022-04-25,0,"Ive found the best thing for my insulin resistance is lifting weights and walking daily. Im not sure what your lifestyle is like, but that would be my suggestion."
melancholalia,2022-04-25,1,"coffee raises my blood sugar a bit in the morning so i bolus as if i was eating ten carbs. never need to bolus for an afternoon diet coke weirdly so i dont know if its caffeine or something about the caffeine in coffee. but either way, totally normal thing many diabetics experience and not cause for alarm about insulin resistance."
KradHe,2022-04-25,1,"I drink 3 double espressos every day, have done for many years (and T1 for decades).
I don't find it affects my glucose levels very much.  
My levels always rise on waking, even without breakfast. If I have coffee but no food, they rise slightly faster than with no food and no coffee, but nothing drastic. Apart from that I don't see much BG effect from caffeine.  
I drink it black without sugar though. On the odd occasion I have it with milk I get a way bigger spike than would be expected from the carb numbers in milk. Something about warm milk especially just sets my levels rocketing."
MrKlos,2022-04-26,1,"Also remember if you are drinking coffee with milk, you need to count it. I tend to forget that last part...."
No_Constant_4056,2022-04-30,1,"yes, my factor raised by 1x more while taking \~160mg of caffeeine with 70g sugar from an can at once. However when i am not taking caffine, my basal/bolus returned normal."

DoctorZiegIer,2022-04-25,2,"&gt; Sounds like BS to me

It isn't. Caffeine can affect blood sugar in some diabetics, especially those who rarely consume caffeine products.

&amp;nbsp;

Caffeine can lead to epinephrine release which by itself leads to increased BG"
Littytiddybiddy,2022-04-25,0,"I would ask a professional, Im just in between endos right now. Not sure the theory is complete BS, but there could be other reasons."

Littytiddybiddy,2022-04-25,2,omg sunburn! Im actually sunburnt right now. Who knew. Thank you for this!
nevermindk9,2022-05-16,7,f'n awesome!
Angieboo2000,2022-05-16,4,Thank you! Its been a struggle but I am feeling great!
Aurawa,2022-05-16,5,Nice job! And don't let those inevitable high moments get in the way of your motivation! I was really good at keeping my numbers down when I started the dexcom but went so high for no god reason so many times that I'm a little higher than I want to be all the time and no longer have that good control. It's a slippery slope but there is lots of support here. Keep it up (down)!
Angieboo2000,2022-05-16,2,Thank you for the kind words! I will try and I wont give up if it gets high :
ClayWheelGirl,2022-05-16,2,"sorry im trying to understand the graph without any markings on the side.

so its healthy if you stay in the gray area? what are the numbers for the low n high part of the gray.

i am delighted for you. i know how much of self control that requires!"
Angieboo2000,2022-05-16,3,So grey is a normal range for a persons sugar to be at (60-200 when eating) the yellow means it is too high and the red is too low. I have mine set to warn me when it gets below 45 and above 250. Thank you so much. It has taken a few months to keep it from going in the yellow or red
ClayWheelGirl,2022-05-16,3,"aaah =O<þ sorry more questions. curiosity.

why warning at below 45? isnt that dangerously low? should you not set it at 60 or is there one at 60 automatically?

can you set your own gray area values? say the highest instead of 200 you want it 160?"
Angieboo2000,2022-05-16,2,"Nah I dont mind the questions. It automatically alerts when it is lower then 60 and dropping, however I dont always feel different. I set it that low because sometimes it doesnt read 100% correct depending on where my sensor is. Most the time my sugar never gets that low unless Im sleep. And yes you can change where the grey scale is. My sugar use to always be high so my doctor said to try and keep it below 250 for a time and then lower my scale until I can get it to 200."
ClayWheelGirl,2022-05-16,2,=O<þso much. this has been a v. helpful conversation!
Angieboo2000,2022-05-16,1,Of course! Anytime!
CoolLukeHand,2022-05-16,2,"Fair play to you, looks tewmendeous. Cut out all carbs and most days can be like that with a little effort.. I know easier said than done... congrats again!"
JBtamu16,2022-05-16,1,Congrats!!! Keep it up!!
Infamous-Leopard7516,2022-05-16,1,HELL YEAH!!! Good job!!!
chrisagiddings,2022-05-16,1,This is great! Keep going! Practice builds strong habits!
gemini_texan,2022-05-08,2,"Yep, I saw one for the first time last month. As someone that dined out 90% of the time for years, it was pretty helpful and eye-opening to have an expert guide me as I switched to a ""clean"" diet. I brought a food log and he was able to tell me what to eat more of and what to lessen. He gave me ideas on what foods fit my lifestyle and were easy to prepare. Also provided goal numbers(x number of calories, x number of sodium, etc.) Its definitely worth a visit. I would advise finding someone that has experience working with diabetics and understands the needs of this community. The particular R.D. I went to was out of network and I paid around $135. I would say $130-$170 is a fair price. Typically the first visit is a bit higher in cost since they are doing the initial intake stuff and designing a plan for you. My insurance is a high-deductible health plan so they ain't coverin' nothing until I hit my deductible."
Sensitive-Win-8151,2022-05-15,1,"Curious how did you find your dietitian, did your doctor refer you to him? I am struggling with finding a good dietitian online (that is in-network with my insurance) lol..."
AeroNoob333,2022-05-09,2,"I do! Well, we do everything online. My registered dietitian is also my strength coach. Hes been a T1D for over 20 years. My main concern was how to balance my fitness goals and insulin dependent diabetes. Hes been super helpful in helping me keep the balance."
Sensitive-Win-8151,2022-05-15,1,"Curious how did you find your dietitian, did your doctor refer you to him? I am struggling with finding a good dietitian online (that is in-network with my insurance) lol..."
AeroNoob333,2022-05-15,1,No. I actually found him on the a T1D Athletes FB group haha. I wanted someone who understood how to manage diabetes in the context of weight lifting. Hes perfect for that!
Sensitive-Win-8151,2022-05-15,1,"Haha nice. In this case, are your visits covered by insurance? I thought I can only see the dietitian my doctor refers lol..."
AeroNoob333,2022-05-15,1,"They are not unfortunately. They are working on different states being covered, but I live in AR right now and it doesnt cover any of it. Not exactly sure how it works tbh."
Sensitive-Win-8151,2022-05-15,1,"Really interesting, so if he is in AR as well, the insurance would cover it? Does not really make any sense since it is telehealth right now anyway&"
m_maggs,2022-05-08,1,"I've been seeing one for years (I usually see her 2-3 times a year). It's been very helpful for me because I have multiple dietary restrictions; I find the dietician more helpful than most of my doctors in terms of managing diet (obviously, right?)... 

She helped me understand my diabetes quite a bit more in depth. She works alongside an obesity doctor, so she was also able to help me calculate my BMR so I knew how many calories to eat a day to lose weight (I'm overweight after years of prednisone/steroid use), and she has helped me figure out better meal alternatives and even what to eat when I'm out on the run (most of my doctors are 2-3 hours one way from me, so when I see them it's a whole day project and I have to eat out). She also helped me better calculate my carb/sugar and protein intake goals... Overall I think she's been very helpful because she focuses more on problem solving rather than blaming or telling me what to do. I explain where I struggle and she offers possible solutions. 

Since using a registered dietician my A1C went from 8.9 down to 6.2 and I've lost 25 lbs. I think the advice and the accountability is what really helped me."
Sensitive-Win-8151,2022-05-15,1,"Curious how did you find your dietitian, did your doctor refer you to him? I am struggling with finding a good dietitian online (that is in-network with my insurance) lol..."
m_maggs,2022-05-15,1,"Yeah, my doctor referred me to her. She normally does in-person, but has swapped to telehealth since the pandemic. Shes part of Keck USC in Los Angeles."
Sensitive-Win-8151,2022-05-15,1,"Got it, thanks a lot!"
Sensitive-Win-8151,2022-05-15,1,One follow up question: are the dietitian visits covered by insurance in your case? especially now it is telehealth.
m_maggs,2022-05-15,1,It is! But its limited in visits. Obviously insurance coverage can vary tho.
Sensitive-Win-8151,2022-05-15,1,Cool that makes sense!
Wcked_Production,2022-05-08,1,A lot of it is just common knowledge but seeing a nutritionist helps keep accountability.
Sensitive-Win-8151,2022-05-15,1,"Curious how did you find your dietitian, did your doctor refer you to him? I am struggling with finding a good dietitian online (that is in-network with my insurance) lol..."
Wcked_Production,2022-05-15,1,My endo is part of a really big group so they have everything you need. My endo is located in a hospital that theyre all referring each other to.
Sensitive-Win-8151,2022-05-15,1,Thanks a lot for sharing! somehow my doctor did not refer me to a dietitian... do you know whether I have to have doctor's referral to see dietitians?
friendless2,2022-05-08,1,"I saw one when first diagnosed, and since there was a delay to get to the appointment, I had already figured out carb estimation on my own and had a journal of my trial and error attempts.  They gave me a list of medications to avoid.

That was the last time I saw one.  22 years ago."
flaz,2022-05-08,1,"We've been to two different ones -- one for my wife, and one for my stepson. One of them was really good at it and we learned a lot, but the other was a lecturing know-it-all that was difficult to listen to and/or care about what she was saying. So I guess, YMMV."
Sensitive-Win-8151,2022-05-15,1,"Curious how did you find your dietitian, did your doctor refer you to him? I am struggling with finding a good dietitian online (that is in-network with my insurance) lol..."
flaz,2022-05-15,1,"Both dietitians were ""in house"" so to speak. Same practice, same office, for both doctors. I guess the doctors hired them."
Sensitive-Win-8151,2022-05-15,1,"very interesting, are the doctor and dietitian essentially private practice?"
flaz,2022-05-15,1,One pair was part of a hospital and the other was private practice.
Sensitive-Win-8151,2022-05-15,1,"Got it, thanks for sharing! wondering: are the dietitian visits covered by insurance in your cases?"
flaz,2022-05-15,1,Yes. Don't ask me why. Insurance is a mystery.
Sensitive-Win-8151,2022-05-15,1,Haha totally agreed...
Bookworm3616,2022-05-08,1,"Yes! Got in a dietitian before endocrinologist. 

I'm not good for numbers. Basically been max out of pocket since February (hence former child of a type 2). I feel it's semi worth it time wise. College kid struggling"
buzzybody21,2022-05-08,1,"Ive been seeing one for 5 years (for my eating disorder), but after I was diagnosed, I kept going. Its worth it!"

buzzybody21,2022-05-15,1,"I found mine through my therapist. Unfortunately she doesnt take insurance. But I started to see her because of my persistent eating disorder at the time (I was 60% of my ideal body weight - Im much more recovered now). I recommend checking in with a primary care or endo. Unfortunately, dieticians are only covered for type 2s who are overweight and out of control. Theyre not typically covered much if at all for type 1s&"
Sensitive-Win-8151,2022-05-15,2,"Thanks for sharing, glad to hear you have recovered a lot now! Yeah it is a good idea to check with PCP or endo, they might be able to make the proper referral."
Sensitive_Mud9356,2022-05-11,1,Thanks a lot everyone!
DatCheeseBoi,2022-05-17,10,"I'm a type 1 so I can't really exactly relate, but what I can suggest is to find some super low carb snacks to help. 

Meats are obviously pretty good, but there's a lot of fat so it's not ideal if you're trying to loose weight. Although the protein is nice for excercise. 

Kohlrabi is the ol' reliable of low carb snacks, as far as nutrition goes you may as well be eating sand, but it tastes pretty good, has a lot of water and vitamins, and a signature 8/10 crunch.

Last but not least, we have a local brand of super dark dark chocolate which turns out to have less than 20g of carbs in the entire bar of chocolate. And I don't mean like a snickers kind of bar, I mean the table looking flat thing with a lot of pieces. It's a bit of carbs, but if you just slowly nibble on it, it will last an entire day, however I am not sure if you have such a brand in your local stores, the only thing you can do is check all the chocolates in the store.

Side note: the fact that in English a chocolate bar is the term used for both the small snacks, and the large grid like item is absolutely disgusting and whoever decided this was a reasonable idea, I hope they suffered a terrible death, cos that's absolutely vile."
Gagirl4604,2022-05-17,2,How do you differentiate them in your part of the world?
DatCheeseBoi,2022-05-17,2,"They have each their own word. Tyinka (meaning bar) for the snickers type stuff. Tabu>ka (meaning board or table (as in table of values on paper) depending on which way you translate it). I was shocked to see that in English they're both just a bar."
Gagirl4604,2022-05-17,7,"Southern US native here& Some people MIGHT call the Snickers type a candy bar and the board type a chocolate bar but theres no guarantee. Its not standard. They would most likely call a Snickers by its name as they would with any very recognizable candy bar like Twix, Reeses, KitKat, etc."
jinkies3678,2022-05-17,2,We can usually distinguish the difference by the brand name.
DatCheeseBoi,2022-05-17,1,"But what if you don't care about the brand and just ask someone to get you a chocolate bar? OH WAIT! WHICH KIND? I don't care that it's a silly little pointless thing, I still hate it."
jinkies3678,2022-05-17,3,"Yeah, I generally just use context clues and know what's in my house. lol."
GoldPenalty7702,2022-05-17,8,The more active I am the less insulin I use and I gain less weight.
Drop9Reddit,2022-05-17,9,"I lost a ton of weight to hit a hard plateau for a good month before starting to progress again. You have to be willing to forgive yourself. And if a diet is not working try an alternate. 

As well there is a mental toll from diabetes no shame is speaking to someone about it."
GeneralTai,2022-05-17,2,Yep Plateau's are a real thing you stop losing weight all of a sudden then you will start again all of a sudden.
Drop9Reddit,2022-05-17,2,Yup absolutely no reason to it. All you can do is stay the course
MizchiefKilz,2022-05-17,7,"It goes up and down based on a lot of things like how much water you are holding. I've had the same issue, lost about 15lbs pretty quick when starting treatment, but then basically leveled off and average loss of around 0.5lb per week. 

Doctor said insulin can cause weight gain and I've recently been taken off it and put on Rybelsus which is supposed to help with weight loss. I'm just glad I don't have to poke myself anymore!"
Dependent_Reason1701,2022-05-17,6,"I can easily gain 2.5kg the week of my period from hormone fluctuations alone. I don't eat differently but the weight goes up, as does my insulin resistance. 

My biggest concern with food is that I can only keep my numbers in check when fasting. Any food, even 0 carb foods will jack me up."
NinjaTurtle2077,2022-05-17,4,"I relate so well to you, same here , fasting 16 hours is what keeps me in check, without fasting even low carb or zero carb will bring my weight up. Even with fasting I have to really limit my low carb intake"
EvLokadottr,2022-05-17,5,"Yeah. I got really sick and almost killed myself on a starvation diet and only got down to 207 pounds (93.8 kilograms) and that was working out CONSTANTLY (knockdown fighting, lifting weights, hiking, swimming, home renovation as a job) when I was pre-diabetic and 10 years younger.   
Now, with menopause and full-blown diabetes happening this year? I despair."
GrumpyKitten1,2022-05-18,1,"I've been losing on menopause by staying very low carb (max 20 net, 30 total, usually lower). I worry about carb more than calories and after an initial drop it's been slow but it is sustainable for me (first time weight loss has been long term sustainable too)."
EvLokadottr,2022-05-19,2,"Yeah, low carb has been better for me than other diets... but even that insane starvation diet was low carb. I'm glad it's helping you! I'm switched back to low carb now, myself. Hoping it'll help."
GrumpyKitten1,2022-05-19,2,I'm 5'4 and eating 1400-1600 calories per day. After the initial weight loss from going low carb it's been very slow but other than a 3 lb fluctuation I have not gained anything. I'd rather slow and sustainable and I'm not going hungry. Any time I've gone lower calorie I eventually binge. I've maintained this way of eating twice as long as my longest previous diet and 4 times longer than most and I don't feel like I'm going nuts and still have minimal cravings.  (I've even made my own low carb ice cream and sushi rolls)
EvLokadottr,2022-05-19,2,"Supposedly I have lost 5 pounds in uhhh less than a week switching to low carb, but I don't believe it. Probably it's a case of my bathroom scale being wrong and the doctor's scale being right, or loss of water weight.   
Usually with low carb, I've lost less and less each time I've done it, (even if I do it for half a year or more,) probably because I'm older now, and my ehlers-danlos syndrome has made me less able to exercise.  


I have noticed an increase in energy, though. Trying swerve for the first time this time, today. I wish my insurance would hurry up and approve my test strips and testing device. I am not sure if swerve will cause a reaction or not. :/ I'd love to be able to test it with actual numbers!   


I hear you on low calorie- honestly, my body will hold on to weight as much as it can when I try to go low calorie. I lost a lot of weight by eating tons of bacon, cheese, and eggs, heh. That was when I was in my 20s, though."
Mal-De-Terre,2022-05-17,5,"As an alternative to the gym, have you considered swimming?"
Julie1760,2022-05-17,4,I have had the very best results with low carb and intermittent fasting! The first week is a bit tough but after that it's honestly the easiest and most maintainable way I've ever lost weight!
Angieboo2000,2022-05-17,3,"I have friends that are actually concerned for my health because I will only eat 1 meal a day and work out almost daily. At first it was originally because I was focused on losing a little weight and controlling my numbers, however it is now an obsession I have. My doctor is now involved because it is become a major health issue for me (hitting lows out of nowhere and passing out when my sugars were fine before hand). Basically my doctor believes that because I am so obsessed with controlling my weight and sugar levels my body is trying to hold on to everything because it believes it is in survival mode. Which is why I struggle to lose weight and why my sugars drop so fast out of nowhere. It might not be the reason for you but I would discuss it with your doctor and see if this is what is going on or if there is something else happening."
Jlvyn12,2022-05-17,3,"For me just controlling my portion size worked and helped me lose 50 pounds. But everyones different. I still eat snacks that are low carbs or if I feel like Im going to explode I eat just a few chips to take the craving away, but dont eat them all! Controlling how much you eat in my opinion is as important as what you eat."
filthydani,2022-05-17,3,Yea eating super low carbs and fasting does manage diabetes but is this how we gonna spend the rest of our lives? This is not a solution sadly
NinjaTurtle2077,2022-05-17,2,"So true , I relate to this"
EvilHomerSimpson,2022-05-17,2,"Keep in mind some calories are more filling than others. for the fisr three months after I was diagnosed I went hard at carnivore, calorie deprevation, with intermittent fasting to get where I wanted to be.

Now I'm keto, with about 2K calories a day and honesly I seldom feel ""hungry"" or deprived. I do get the occasional desire to snack (just had a cookie with my coffee) 

Regardin the gym and injuries, get a set of resistence bands at home. It's what I use because they are better on the body than free weights, don't take a ton of space, and are easy to use while you do other things."
StrangerGlue,2022-05-17,2,"Can you see a physiotherapist for more resistance training? If you can walk, you should be able to do at least light resistance training. After her recent surgeries, my mom was doing resistance before she could stand, let alone walk. Both of our blood sugars are much better when we do aerobic and resistance exercises."
jonathanlink,2022-05-17,1,What about body weight exercises?  Is every part of you injured that you cant work out to add muscle?  Adding muscle will go a very long way to regulating your ability to handle food (more food) moving forward.
Kathw13,2022-05-17,1,Talk to your doctor about meds that promote weight loss. I take insulin so I counter act the weight gain side effects with Farxiga and Ozempic.

You can just stick to maintenance calories, too, if you cant lift weights because of injuries."
jinkies3678,2022-05-17,1,"I have a hernia history that makes a lot of exercise difficult. Weights are flat out not in my plan. I'm finding that resistance band workouts are a great alternative (I've found a lot of good workout videos on youtube for these), combined with walking several days a week. I'm recently diagnosed T2 (less than a month) but am down 85 or so pounds in the last 14 months. Down about 5 since I was diagnosed."
AeroNoob333,2022-05-17,1,"Yeah thats fine, you just need to count your macros and/or calories and determine what your maintenance calories are for the activity level and type that you do."
jinkies3678,2022-05-17,0,Yup. Constantly tracking.
aam2022,2022-05-17,0,"Well its a lot of comments to read all and Im sure theyre all worth it! Lets not forget that your bone density and muscle mass are what is the most important and Not the weight on of the scales. 

Im a type one and am a food coach and a group and personal trainer. I recommend using ashwagandha to help with glucose levels (aside from all its other powers). Aside from that use insulin to feed your muscles the carbs it needs! Remember the human body is originally made to move! So keep pushing, pulling, squatting, hinging, lunging, and carrying! There are other things natural that can help with regulation and over all just beneficial to your hormones, brain, and heart.

I dont mind setting sometime with you if you actually want the guidance, we can make it a two to three week experiment, and if you like it maybe youd like to train with my guidance for what ever it is (knee or joint issues, fat lose, muscle mass increase, relaxation, etc). I wouldnt even charge the typical $120 an hour cost, but lets say a fraction of that. Im a wellness professional. But yea Ive encountered lots of issues and have over come them.

AlexLeeDunn,2022-05-02,13,"Yep. I'm sitting here trying to get a fresh sensor to understand I am not having a low, my BG is close to 300. Keep fighting the good fight."
littlehunts,2022-05-02,8,You too. This really sucks
AlexLeeDunn,2022-05-02,5,I got a larger than normal amount of blood when I inserted the sensor. Must have nailed a decent patch of veins. That usually tells me I am going to be in for a rough first 24 hours if the thing lasts that long.
nrgins,2022-05-02,3,"Sensors usually take about 12 hours to become accurate. So if it's a fresh sensor you probably won't get accurate reading. Whenever the reader or app gives you the little blood icon, that means you need to double check with your meter because the reading might not be accurate."
TheBigYinnie1106,2022-05-02,0,"The Dutch version of the app doesn't give you the blood icon. Don't know why not. I was told it takes 24 hours to ""settle"" and become as accurate as is possible.

I place a new sensor on my arm 24 hours before the current runs out. Then I scan the new one and remove the, then, old one."
ukkohertell,2022-05-02,1,I think it's everywhere in Europe. The European regulations don't require calibration (not sure what exactly is said in the regulations. It might just be up to approval)
nrgins,2022-05-02,0,"I just realized that the op was using dexcom. I assumed they were using Libre, so that's my fault. The Libre app gives you the blood icon. I don't know about the dexcom app.

And yeah, it starts to become more accurate after 12 hours but 24 hours is best.

And I do the same thing. I put a new sensor on 24 to 48 hours before the old one expires."
TheBigYinnie1106,2022-05-02,0,"I use the Libre app. No blood icon, though."
nrgins,2022-05-02,0,Weird.
TheBigYinnie1106,2022-05-02,0,"Yup. There is more that is not available on the Dutch market. Not big enough, so not enough profit."
nrgins,2022-05-02,0,"I mean, you would think it would be the same app in either market, even if they change the language. Doesn't make sense that they would have a different app entirely."
TheBigYinnie1106,2022-05-02,1,"I know, it doesn't."
nrgins,2022-05-02,8,"LOL don't overreact. You're not fucked. That happens sometimes. I once had to tell me to wait 9 hours. Like you, I got nervous. And then I googled that message and saw that it happened a lot and that cleared itself up with other people. So take a breath, relax, and get your glucose meter out in the meantime.

By the way, I had problems with the Libre for a while until I started using over patches on top of them, as well as skin tac before I put it on. Now I don't have issues anymore and the sensor seems to be more accurate. I think a lot of the issues with the sensor have to do with it being bumped, even slightly, because it affects the sensor under the skin."
lemonfluff,2022-05-02,5,Can you not test manually for now? Often with a sensor error the sensor says you're crashing right before it fails but that's not always the case. Definitely check manually of you can!
jehkjehk,2022-05-02,2,"This happened to me yesterday after it gave me an urgent low message so I fingerpricked and it needed a +100 calibration. LOL! It took probably 20 minutes to work again, so you will be okay."
PuffBoofPass,2022-05-02,2,When this shit happens to me I make sure to just pretend like I dive bombed to 40. Id rather have to correct another possibly worse high blood sugar rather than a dangerously low one

Ninethlevel,2022-05-02,1,Why do we act like we cannot manage our diabetes without new tech?

cascer1,2022-05-07,1,"Because it sucks to go back to manual testing after having a sensor.

Surely you use a car instead of a horse drawn carriage?"
Lausannea,2022-05-07,1,"People have different needs. It's good to be mindful of this and respect people's needs.

Before new tech people died early from complications. There's a reason new tech exists and is given to diabetics almost immediately upon diagnosis these days. Let's not be condescending about the management plan that works for people just because you can get it done differently, alright?"

CadoAngelus,2022-05-02,1,It's worth having a backup blood meter in this kind of event. Even if you mostly are fine with the CGM.
GingerBaby2019,2022-04-28,23,"My CGM, changed my diabetes life. It took the misery out of it and allowed me to focus on food and health instead of all the other supplies I needed to to check my blood sugar. I got my numbers from 11.7 down to 5.9 it took awhile and I changed my diet and started to exercise but it all started with my CGM it gave me control and hope."
Saramander46,2022-04-28,4,"Yeah, having one really changes everything. It finally isn't a big hassle anymore. 

Keep up the good work! :)"

iamclickbaut,2022-04-28,8,"My CGM and pump made a huge difference for me. (that and the right Endo)  but being able to see how different foods reacted, and how long each took.  I like having the almost instant feedback that my CGM gives me.

Keep it up!"

BKCowGod,2022-04-28,4,CGM is like moving from a few still photos to watching a movie. Congrats on taking the step!
Saramander46,2022-04-28,2,"That's a very good metaphor, it really is like that yeah"
crowort,2022-04-28,4,"Ive been there. As a teen and into my late 20s I used to just inject enough insulin to stay out of full DKA. I rarely went to appointments so got kicked out of clinics and the rare Hb1acs were 12-15% 

I finally decided I had to start looking after myself. I got my hb1ac down too 6.5% but was starting to get burnout. I then got a pump and then a Libre sensor, these helped me stay at better levels without injecting twice for some meals and testing almost hourly.

Hope my story helps you see it is possible and others have had similar issues and problems and came out the other side."
chrisagiddings,2022-04-28,3,"I got a CGM early after my diagnosis last year. But as an engineer much of what I do is reinforced by data. The benefit of seeing the data from my CGM reinforces the good habits and helps keep me on track. Without it, Im sure Id get annoyed at pricking my fingers and all the other crap and Id be off track fast.

If youre like me, and seeing the data makes it real, and it being real makes it actionable for you. Then the CGM will change your life, and fast."
Saramander46,2022-04-28,2,"Yeah, seeing the data really helps for me too. I now understand my body better and can do more with my data. 

And pricking your finger each time is such a hassle. It doesn't take that long or anything, but it's long enough for me to just not do it or procrastinate it indefinitely"
chrisagiddings,2022-04-28,1,"I love being able to combine my data points across various apps using something like Apple Health. 

I use a Withings Body+ scale that gives me weight, bone density, hydration and like a dozen other metrics.

And I use Lifesum to track my food intake along with other macros.

Since both apps use Apple Health they have access to both apps data so I dont need to enter it twice.

But the Libre 2 app doesnt do Apple Health and it really annoys me. Dexcom does. And Im looking at switching CGMs precisely for this reason."
FuzzyDunlop007,2022-04-28,3,"Hey, Ive been there. Ive been controlled for 3 years. Ive been diabetic for 23 years. This disease is hard. Im glad youre trying. Youre going to feel so much better. Your A1C can come down. Good luck and you can do this!"
Saramander46,2022-04-28,1,Thank you very much! Good luck too! :)
Leeanth,2022-04-28,3,"Good for you! I'm trying to do the same.

My last a1c was 7, which was pretty amazing as I started somewhere north of 10 in October last year when diagnosed.

However, I felt like a charlatan. I had my third Covid vax in January and was hit by almost a month of battling lows, so I knew my a1c would be ""falsely"" low.

My endo reduced my basal by two units to help combat the lows. Unfortunately, a few days later I was going high all the time. After the massive highs persisted for more than a week, with concerning keytones, I decided to increase my basal again, but by one unit instead of the two I'd dropped. It sort of worked. I was no longer constantly massively high; just a bit high.

My next  a1c will look bad compared to the last, so I decided to get more aggressive with bolusing. I also reset my CGM alarms. My low alarm is now 4.2 mmol/L (about 82.5 mg) and my high is 9.8 mmol/L (about 175 mg). Both are still within target range. If the low alarm goes off, I will do something about it immediately. If the high goes off, I kind of improvise depending on the direction fo the arrow, but keep a close watch on it."
Cute-Aardvark5291,2022-04-28,3,"a tip of mine from a friend (who has been T1 since birth) is that if you are getting late night lows from the bolus, see about splitting between late night and am. it might help. 

And congrats for your work so far!"

Run-And_Gun,2022-04-28,2,CGMs are an eye-opener.  I always thought I had at least decent control.  Until I saw what my BS was really doing.  Especially after meals.
AnxiousJedi,2022-04-28,2,"Hang in there buddy! I dragged my feet for years when it came to dealing with my type 2 diagnosis. It seems like a monumental task at first, but it gets easier with time. It's also quite rewarding to see that A1c come down."
TiltedKangolHat,2022-04-29,1,can I ask how long?  I'm on year 4 since diagnosis with only about one year in between where I actually took care of myself... sometimes I feel like it's just too late to 'fix' myself

tomytronics,2022-05-07,33,"There have been other stories like this. When an employee is familiar with diabetes, they usually will know what to do when someone's dropping too much. I remember a news not too long ago that someone in drive through McDonald's needed some OJ because of diabetes. The manager got OJ, added extra sugar, and went outside to serve directly rather than waiting for them to pull up and pay and receive."
GuardianAngelTurtle,2022-05-07,24,I loved when a diabetic would come through my line in the grocery store and ask if they could please start eating the candy bar they had before they paid so I could point them to a bench near me so I could keep an eye on them while I brought them checkout candy until their sugar came back up and then wave them out of the store without paying once they felt better because it was like 3 bucks worth
milanico2309,2022-05-08,5,"When Im low I will just go in the store, get a coke or something and drink it without asking. never had anyone question that, I just put the empty can on the checkout and pay it when leaving the store."
GuardianAngelTurtle,2022-05-08,4,Thats what I do too but some people get nervous. The guy Im thinking about was I think pakistani? So possibly nervous about appearing like a thief

iamtheeviitwin,2022-05-09,2,"It could be person to person. I'm just saying what my doctor has told me.

As for 600s. Your A1C is probably like 10-12. Which is incredibly high and a danger for stroke/heart attack"

iamtheeviitwin,2022-05-09,0,"=K@ I was. Last year. I was having chest pain. They called an ambulance.  In the ER my sugar was 374. That's when I was DX as diabetic.  My A1C was 7.8. My doctor put me on metformin and then added trulicity. Then removed the metformin.  
In the last year, I've dropped 65lb, my A1C dropped to 5.9 and my cholesterol dropped 111 points. I KNOW when my sugar is up. And for me, UP is 160s. I get a headache. And if it's high for more than 2 days, my skin feels like I have a film on it. So I make sure to regulate myself.


Every person is different. Every case if diabetes is different.  Every doctor is different.  These are my experiences. Take it or leave it."
AnonMari20,2022-05-15,1,"I believe you lol. But Thats pretty amazing dropping so much. I did the same. My a1c was good and then Im current out of control. Like you, when Im really controlled, the 160s is obvious and I get the headaches and irritability.. I have anxiety that comes and goes in severity (Ive been diagnosed as bipolar 2 and anxiety, along with the diabetes, Im soooo lucky). I usually associate the chest pain with my anxiety because it just gets sooooo bad. Im usually focused on trying to relax and never really think about my blood sugar. Ive been struggling with my depression which is probably what messes up my blood sugar sooo much.  I also dgaf about my blood sugar."
YoYoYoshimura,2022-05-09,9,"Did you wash your hands before you tested? This is going to sound insane, but if you had something on your hands there is a decent chance it affected your results.

mice-infestation,2022-05-09,4,I didn't wash my hands before. It was probably so high because I was snacking on grapes before I tested
YoYoYoshimura,2022-05-09,10,"And there we have it. If fruit juices were on the finger where you tested there is a very high chance thats why you have an aberrant blood sugar in the 300s. 

You still have a high risk for type 2 with your dad being T2, so it might be good to work on losing weight and get that off the list of risk factors that affect you. 

Good luck!!"

PathRevolutionary355,2022-05-09,0,"I hope your glucometer is correct. 300+ is too high to believe you are still standing on your legs. the variation I could see is huge from 6:36pm to last reading. Had you taken anything at around 10 to 10:15 pm? anything specific to your dinner? Figure out what was added in them. Just to give you an example, I had been eating bread for almost my life now for breakfast. One day suddenly I saw my sugar levels increased abnormally post breakfast. it took me 3 days to figure out my wife had changed the bread manufacturer. The new manufacturer might be adding something that I don't know but was triggering my blood sugar levels. later we switched back to our old manufacture and again I am back to regular sugar level. You need to deep dive to this extent to understand any specific food item in your dinner that might have triggered this much sugar level. and as people advised, do consult doctor. Also ask doc for supplements. I have been using supplements for some years now. they do wonders in controlling sugar levels."
mice-infestation,2022-05-09,1,"I'm not diagnosed with anything. Before I tested, I was eating grapes. Could that trigger it?"
PathRevolutionary355,2022-05-09,1,"if consumed in bulk, it could be. A cup of grapes should not increase blood sugar but like all fruits grapes contain carbohydrates and can raise blood sugar."

beowhulf,2022-05-19,13,"you speak my heart, i hate G6 so much on its last 2 days, was giving me lows whole morning, seemed fishy, so i test from finger and i was 19,8mmol..... i never trust a sensor post its first 6 days, it just never lasts in my case."
jacktree,2022-05-19,7,"I typically never have that happen. Usually its the first day, maybe, of a new sensor that the sensor can seem off. Since you mentioned morning, make sure youre drinking enough water! Ive had my Dex give me weird readings and/or not read at all if Im even slightly dehydrated."
beowhulf,2022-05-19,3,"thanks for tips but i know where the issue is, had 6+ sensors with the same issue and its always the same pattern, morniing was just an example from this morning, but it goes like this, apply new sensor, 6-7 days are great, and then theres blind spots and totally off readings, the fiber inside is bent or dirty and i have to replace early. It happens everytime i put on a site where i can lie on it, if i use inside of my arm it lasts more but then it gets peeled off easier. It works only if you dont touch it and the place is not very flexible. If I use outside of my arm, after few nights it stops working, i have very bad sleep and move a lot and perform all kinds of gymnastics and the once you sleep on the sensor it stops working. Never happened with Libre, only with Dexcom, thats why i ""hate  it"" cause its the tech they are using, Libre is much more durable."
jacktree,2022-05-20,2,"I wear mine, exclusively, on the back of either arm (just above the meat of the tricep). Im not an easy sleeping either, swapping sides constantly throughout the night or to my back. The first day, maybe two, is slightly uncomfortable, after that though, its usually golden for the 10 days.

I only run into issues of it falling off in the summer when Im sweating a lot and/or showering a lot. I love the G6."
beowhulf,2022-05-20,1,"You see that is what i was trying as well, but when you sleep on the side or your back and arms to your body you sleep on the sensor, i dont mind it being uncomfortable, i mind it stopping working post these nights, i think the pressure on the sensor from the bed just makes it go haywire everytime, not sure what your ttrick is :)"
PBandJames,2022-05-20,1,I finally accepted that I do have to calibrate my G6 as much as my G5.
AKJangly,2022-05-21,1,"I just had that happen for my first time. Calibration calibration calibration. Calibrate once per day!

Diabeast_5,2022-05-20,6,"My G6 has been leagues better than medtronic's cgm ever was. It was constantly wrong, whereas the G6 has been rarely wrong."
AeroNoob333,2022-05-20,1,"My endo prescribed me an InPen and I had to go on the phone with the guys from Medtronic to get some insurance stuff done. They were trying to sell me the Guardian CGM. When I messaged my endo about it, she literally called me and was like DO NOT GET THAT! That CGM sucks!!! Keep using the Dexcom even if it cant communicate to the InPen in real time. (shes also my cousin so she can say stuff like this to me lol)"
ZoneDoctor,2022-05-20,2,"Agree, used their CGM and hated it. Always requiring another finger stick. Made me test more often than the Endo told me I needed to. Switched to Dexcom and only have good things to say... except that they should allow replaceable and/or rechargeable batteries. That's why I recently ordered the Anubis (modified) transmitter.

Concerning the pumps, however, I do love the Medtronic pump. Wish it interfaced with the Dexcom CGM, but it doesn't hurt like the t:slim X2 pump did sometimes. The piston action delivered too much insulin at one time for my skin to handle. That has never happened with any Medtronic pump I've used so far, no small stabs of pain with insulin delivery."
droopymaroon,2022-05-20,2,"I hear a lot of complaints about this sensor/pump but honestly its been pretty good for me. Its certainly annoying at times as it often requires back to back calibrations and what not, but is generally pretty reliably accurate for me. Ill certainly try something else next go around to see if its just cause I have no other frame of reference, though."
AleksandrNevsky,2022-05-19,1,"God, I hated that pump. Can't wait to actually get ok'd for a new one."
Morgoz,2022-05-20,2,What do you hate about it?
bearded_fisch_stix,2022-05-20,6,"my gripes with it are as follows: demands a new meter reading if your bg is too stable for too long, won't let you set a target for auto mode lower that 120mg/dl, the screen is the wrong way around to try using with it clipped to your belt, strings of alerts that seem to never end even after the first screen told you what you needed to know, won't talk to the meter I want to use (came with an accu-chek guide link, but my insurance wants me to use the contour test strips that my previous pump used, so I'm still using the old meter), shit's bulky on the belt, medtronic clips are shit so I use a holster from type 1 tactical"
Morgoz,2022-05-20,5,Ahh yeah the biggest thing that bugs me is entering a BG to calibrate and then two minutes later it says it needs another BG for auto mode. I dont use the belt attachment but everything else you listed is definitely an issue I have as well.
ew73,2022-05-20,3,"The auto-mode loop was a bug in the transmitter firmware.  The fix is a replacement transmitter.  If you're getting stuck in that never-ending loop, contact Medtronic and get your free replacement."
Morgoz,2022-05-21,1,"Oh ok, good to know. I just got a replacement so hopefully that wont be an issue any longer! Thanks!"
AleksandrNevsky,2022-05-20,2,"The menu system is painful to use even when you get used to the pump. The fact you basically had to play simon says to get it to open the menu in the first place is real annoying when muscle memory kicks in. It was like having a pump with a captcha. I can not stress enough that the user interface sucks horribly.

You can't silence alarms or alerts for more than a minute. This was really annoying when I was in college classes. It was like dealing with a brat that absolutely has to have your attention right now and can't wait. Unless you pulled the battery and let it die you had to deal with it right away even when it's incredibly inconvenient to do so.

""Just wait class is over in 15 minutes and this is important."" ""No fuck you deal with me right now!""

The alerts for low battery also made no sense. The battery is low...why are you wasting energy vibrating and sending out pings every 5 seconds? Tell me once and I'll change the battery as soon as I can.

It has a built in limit for how much insulin you can get at once, this is a safety feature so I can kind of understand it but I couldn't override it even in the settings which annoys me. I have a stupidly high resistance to insulin so I hit that ceiling frequently meaning I have to bolus once, wait for it to finish, then bolus the rest. I can and have forgotten to do the second bolus before because of this.

It was really picky about the meters it connected to. I have about a dozen of the same kind as the above picture and maybe 2 of them could connect to it (and both broke eventually) because the keycode needed to be an exact length with no variation. I just put them in BG manually which isn't the end of the world but it is a basic feature of the pump and it was annoying it didn't work.

It's cumbersome. The clip hangs off your belt in an annoying way that tended to catch on things.

I don't have a lot nice to say about the pump. I can't wait to move onto a Tslim."
bonrmagic,2022-05-20,1,There is an option to silence all sensor alerts / alarms for however long you want.
AleksandrNevsky,2022-05-20,1,"Tried it. There's some alarms that still go through, namely blockage detected (which happened a lot because this pump was really sensitive to it) and reservoir at zero. Even if it did get every single one silenced I can't exactly leave it on all the time. My gripe is the alerts by default should have had a ""sweet spot"" somewhere between ""dead silent"" and ""like a chihuahua on meth"""
bonrmagic,2022-05-20,1,I mean Id still like those to stay on tbh
AleksandrNevsky,2022-05-20,1,"Yes, so would I. I don't want the alarms off I want them toned down from completely obnoxious. No alerts is irresponsible and risky but it doesn't need to be a constant auditory barrage."
Wiseguy599999,2022-05-20,1,For me its usually the first few hours after warmup when the G6 plots a graph that looks like a roller coaster. Once calibrated it seems to behave but man it can keep me up at night
Straight-External401,2022-05-20,1,The other day my pump told me my blood sugar was 24 lol

bearded_fisch_stix,2022-05-20,1,I looked at the tandem when it was time for my last update and i'm hesitant about the touchscreen. I like physical buttons. The giant stockpile of medtronic sets and reservoirs i've accumulated over the last decade is another thing keeping me with them. only a few more years before I get to re-evaluate what pump/cgm to use.

In my case it was not very accurate, the patch was falling off after a few days and I was barely able to keep it in place for whole two weeks 

But I know people who are wearing them without any troubles, swimming, running etc. It may be a matter of skin. 

To be honest you'll do the best if you'll try it. This technology is super useful for diabetics

EDIT: lol I just realised it's for dog xD I'm not sure how it will stay in place - you'd need to shave it before application. Also not sure how it will work for dog never heard about using this on animals. It may be super interesting if you'll try this out and share some experience :)"
Rockitnonstop,2022-04-30,1,"I really like my libre and the libre 2. The only difference between them is that the libre 2 has alarms. I would think that if your dog is particularly fluffy, you may need to shave a small spot to where it adheres to. IV prep pads can give some additional adhesive that may help it stick better, but your dog may be creative and find ways to scratch/bite/rub it off. The libre 1 is not as sticky/falls off way more for me than the libre 2.

As a fellow pet owner, I would encourage you to think about you pets quality of life when trying it out. If they really dont like it, and it doesnt stay on, dont keep trying. Animals get stressed by what they find scary and unusual, so even though finger pokes may be a pain, they might be mentally better for your dog.

All in all, just test it and see if it is a good fit. I would be very amused to see a dog with a cgm out around town."

KokoPuff12,2022-05-03,8,"This can happen if the sensors have the same number. The way Dexcom has told me to overcome it is to keep the transmitter detached from the sensors for 15 minutes. Honestly, it only takes five minutes for the transmitter to reach out to the sensor for a reading and realize it is disconnected, but 15 is the rule of thumb they gave me."
surfwacks,2022-05-03,3,"Thank you! Thats what Im trying now. I had the transmitter off for a while and it disconnected in the meantime. I snapped it back in and its connected again, just going through the 2 hour warm up again."
KokoPuff12,2022-05-03,3,"Is it fails, report it to Dexcom and they will replace it."
Vuladi,2022-05-03,1,"The repeat of the sensor number is 100% the issue.  There is a way to re-use the same sensor by stopping the session and then popping the transmitter out of the sensor. Then you wait 15-20 minutes and reinsert the transmitter into the sensor and start the new session with the same code. I've been doing this for years now, but if I do not wait long enough after popping the transmitter out I will get that same error.

Also, like in your case, if I get a new sensor with the same number as the last one I need to wait between sessions to avoid the error.  Seems like they would provide more sensor code variety, but it is what it is. I've had the same code from new sensors like 3-4 times in a row sometimes, it's weird but just something you need to be aware of."
BKCowGod,2022-05-03,1,That is odd. Were there any difficulties putting in and starting the new sensor? Did you interact with it at all after you inserted?
surfwacks,2022-05-03,1,"No. Ive heard this is a somewhat common problem since Ive been googling like crazy the last hour. First I was freaked out because my old and new sensor had the same code, but apparently it doesnt matter. A lot of people are saying to wait 20 mins or so between taking the transmitter off and putting it on the new one. So Im trying that. I suppose if that fails, Ill scan the code when I get home instead of typing it in. I suppose I could also try forgetting the transmitter from my Bluetooth device and restarting that as well."
BKCowGod,2022-05-03,1,"I've been running a G6 since they came out and never run into the issue. I change over the second one ends, I never scan. Call Dexcom, they will be able to give you insight and send you a new sensor."
surfwacks,2022-05-03,1,"Huh, interesting. There were many people in a couple other threads on the error saying dexcom told them to wait 15 mins in between. And of course many others saying theyve never had an issue lol. But definitely planning to call dexcom if its not working in another couple hours!"
BKCowGod,2022-05-03,1,"Yeah, not saying their  description is invalid. I have had an usually good track record"
surfwacks,2022-05-03,1,"I always have bad luck in the beginning with these things. Went through like 3 freestyle libre sensors before getting the hang of it, now getting to start all over with the dexcom lol"
melancholalia,2022-05-03,1,maybe a silly question but did you put a new sensor code in when you started the new sensor? if you can type out here the process you went through replacing the sensor maybe we can figure out if you skipped a step or something. it sounds like dexcom thinks you are reusing an old sensor.
surfwacks,2022-05-03,1,"1) put on the new sensor this morning because the old one would expire while at work, but didnt start it. I took a picture of the code. I saved the paper in case I needed the QR code, but thats at home, not with me at work. 

2) waited for the old sensor to expire, removed it, popped the transmitter out 

3) started the new sensor in the dexcom app, typed the code in, and immediately popped the transmitter in (same transmitter, only been using it like 10 days so definitely not expired yet). 

4) about 30 mins in, it told me no restarts - sensor can only be used once even though its brand new and the old sensor is sitting in a sharps container

Edit: in case it matters& 1) the code on my new sensor is the same 4 digits as the old sensor, 2) my transmitter is still in my known Bluetooth devices, but it says not connected, and 3) i exclusively use the iOS app, I do not have a receiver"
melancholalia,2022-05-03,1,"hmm ok, there are two possibilities here, and the first one is more likely the culprit  the new sensor you put it was already adjusted to your body's interstitial fluid, so the transmitter read it as a sensor that has already been in use. this is a (mostly educated) guess. the warm up period probably has something to do with the filament of the sensor interacting with the interstitial fluid (which is what it measures as opposed to your blood). so basically as far as i know you can't really slap a new sensor on before the old one is done and then just clip in the transmitter.

i'd also recommend next time you do a sensor change to wait 10-15 minutes in between sensors. not 100% sure why, but general consensus is that's best practice to make sure sensors don't fail or warm up incorrectly.

i'd call dexcom up and tell them that you had an issue with your new sensor warming up and it failed during warmup (no need to mention you inserted it before the other one was over...) and they should send you a new one. you can even just fill out the form here: [https://dexcom.custhelp.com/](https://dexcom.custhelp.com/) and they'll send you a new one.

totally understandable mistake for a beginner to make! it's normally a pretty straightforward system, but there are little hacks and things you learn along the way."
surfwacks,2022-05-03,1,"Ohhhh okay, thank you, that makes sense. Its a lot different than my libre- I would typically have to put it on 3 days in advanced in order to get accurate readings from day 1. Never had issues since it didnt use codes or anything. Some people told me pre-soaking the dexcom would be okay but next time I switch, I wont do that."
melancholalia,2022-05-03,1,"ooh interesting  yeah never used libre so don't really know much about the differences. and haven't been told one way or another about pre soaking, just a hunch that the transmitter may mistakenly think it's still the same sensor, especially if it's the same sensor code. but yeah always best to play it safe and just do a full change when it's time.

and with the G7 coming soon, the warm up time will be down to half an hour, which is amazing!

editing to add: scrolling through the G7 site on dexcom  looks like there will be a 12 hour grace period for this generation so you can do exactly this! https://www.dexcom.com/g7-ce-mark"
surfwacks,2022-05-03,2,"Yeah it makes perfect sense what you said! Since I never had to deal with a transmitter before, I never thought about it actually needing some instability at first. I imagine going from one sensor to the next with similar readings would confuse it!"
melancholalia,2022-05-03,1,"yeah for sure. tbh i dont fully understand how it works& i think the code is to tell the transmitter how to interpret the raw data from the sensor or something? but yeah it can be a little persnickety sometimes. good news is the G7 will be all in one, so im imagining itll drastically reduce this and similar hiccups."
surfwacks,2022-05-03,1,"Im not sure how the codes work either, especially when sometimes the codes are identical lol, and also you can put a sensor in without a code (from what Ive ready, doing this requires more calibration)"
melancholalia,2022-05-03,1,"if you use the code, you dont need to calibrate at all (technicallysome people do. i personally have done it maybe three times total, since the system is designed to not require it). but yeah without the code it will require calibration."
melancholalia,2022-05-03,1,"if you use the code, you dont need to calibrate at all (technicallysome people do. i personally have done it maybe three times total, since the system is designed to not require it). but yeah without the code it will require calibration."
MacManT1d,2022-05-03,1,"&gt;so basically as far as i know you can't really slap a new sensor on before the old one is done and then just clip in the transmitter.

That's interesting, because I've presoaked every sensor I've ever put on for about the last four hours of the sensor before, with nary a difficulty.  I also restart them, again with nary a difficulty.  I just take the old sensor off, take out the transmitter, wait twenty minutes, and start it as a new sensor, or for a restart I take the transmitter out without removing the sensor, wait twenty minutes, and start it as a new sensor.  I think the fifteen to twenty minutes is the important part, as it lets everything reset."
melancholalia,2022-05-03,1,oh interesting thats good to know! ive never tried that before so i was just going on a semi educated guess. but if thats the case then yeah for OP the time in between restarting must be the issue
in_the_sheyd,2022-05-03,1,"Its a really scummy business practice that puts diabetics lives in danger but Dexcom put code in their transmitters to measure the amount of noise in the signal during the warmup period to detect sensor restarts. The idea is that because sensors that have been in the body for a few days work better with less noise if a new sensor isnt noisy its likely being reused.

Obviously this is really annoying if youre trying to restart sensors but its also prone to false positives when youre using actual new sensors. One important thing is that the sensor is much more likely to be flagged as restarted if your blood sugar is stable during the warm up, in my experience.

Dexcom will replace the sensor if this happens to you but of course if it wastes your last sensor youre kinda screwed. Though, the sensor restart procedure might still save you&"
surfwacks,2022-05-03,1,"I didnt even know people could restart sensors until I started looking up this error message today. Super interesting, my libre wasnt capable of that at all. Might be a helpful thing to learn how to do if Im ever in a pinch"

diabadcat,2022-04-29,4,"I switched from omnipod to tslim recently so Ive had experience with both, and both have pros/cons! 

Omnipod is tubeless which is great, but everyones skin reacts differently and after using pods for years I developed reactions to the adhesive, and the adhesive on pods covers more of your skin. I also got tired of having to carry the pdm with me, and wanted to have the pump attached/in one place. 

Tslim has control iq which is a game changer if youre able to get a dexcom along with it. The tubing is something to get used to, but its easy enough to tuck inside pants and hide from children. You may need to try a couple types of infusion sets if you have issues (cannulas with some types can kink easier for some people). 

Omnipod is coming out with their version of control iq at some point this year, so it really comes down to preference between tubing/tubeless. If youre able to do a trial for either Id suggest that. Also, if you have insurance check the coverage for both (on mine, for example, pods are under pharmacy and tslim is durable medical equipment, making it cheaper).

diabadcat,2022-04-29,1,"You cant go wrong with either! Tslim also has a 30 day return policy if you end up not liking it (I almost returned it due to the autosoft xcs kinking, but then I tried tru steel). Also welcome to the diabetes club, remember that youre never alone!"

angienun93,2022-04-28,2,Omnipod!!
younghannahg,2022-04-28,2,"I am going to get an omni-pod. The reason I wanted it was because I have two kids, and I just know that my cord would be pulled on all the time. An Omnipod have no cords. Both are great, but an Omnipod seemed so much more practice with kids."
ChronicallyIllBadAss,2022-04-28,1,That is good I mean I am only with kids 2 hours a day but I worry about that one getting ripped off by curious kids
twinmom06,2022-04-29,2,I've had the Omnipod and hated it.  Constantly knocking them off my arm and had a reaction to the adhesive.  I've had the tslim now for about 6 months.  I purchased a pump band with a pocket from RevelWear to sleep (as I sleep *ahem* naturally) and it works well.
Weekly_Research_,2022-04-29,2,"I have used a medtronic ever since I could get a pump. The amount of times tubing has caught a cupboard handle and resulting in me screaming F*CK is astronomical. Sleeping won't be an issue, but I have started to feel uncomfortable sleeping as I'm very likely to wake up if I sleep on it. I have done a trial on the pod, and loved the slim tubeless feature. I used to think they were really bulky, but if it means less ripping from the cord, I'm happy. 

The endo brought up too that because I don't change sites often, I don't absorb well and was forced to use other sites to give my favourites a break. The pod has a time limit of 2 days or something so it kind of forces you to change sites, which in my mind is a healthier way of living."
Asbolus_verrucosus,2022-04-29,2,"I use Omnipod and its great. It can also be used with DIY Loop for automated insulin delivery based on CGM readings. 

As far as durability, nothing surpasses it as its disposable. If it happens to get damaged in any way, just put a new one on."
buzzybody21,2022-04-28,1,"If you need a sturdy pump, I would not recommend the tslim. The screen is glass, and shatters easily. The charging port cover also wears out and comes off easily. 

If you work with kids, loose tubing might not be smart, as it is subject to pulling, which could remove your pump site. 

I use the omnipod, and have not once broken anything. Pods come off, but adhesive isnt perfect."
ChronicallyIllBadAss,2022-04-28,0,"Ok thank you,  the tubing wouldnt be a concern as that I can tape or put under clothing I am more worried about it being pulled off or falling off in my sleep if that makes sense& so yea maybe something I get tangled in isnt a good idea.."
buzzybody21,2022-04-28,1,"Its unlikely itll suffer any damage in your sleep. Its remarkably difficult to damage a pump in your sleep. But I would be more concerned that a kiddo would pull on it or some such, and that would be the end of your pump."
ChronicallyIllBadAss,2022-04-28,0,Yea same
DEFIANTxKIWI,2022-04-29,3,"I have a t-slim and I am a wild sleeper, tossing and turning constantly, just doing the most when in dream land. No issues to report with any tubing or having any damage to the pump or myself"
ChronicallyIllBadAss,2022-04-29,0,That is awesome because this one seems like the one I am more leaning to because of my job and that I cant have anything on my arm
DEFIANTxKIWI,2022-04-29,0,"Not sure what your job is, but the tubing definitely can get tangled in other stuff. I usually get caught on something once a month or so, which isnt that bad, but if you work around delicate stuff or things that can get pulled off of shelves and stuff you'd need to find a way to wrangle the tubing in for sure. Not a huge deal, but just a little bit more of a hassle"
ChronicallyIllBadAss,2022-04-29,1,I am a lunch lady technically but no nothing would catch it because it would be under my clothing and there are many type one kiddos at my job so I would think I would be ok with it not being pulled on
DEFIANTxKIWI,2022-04-29,1,"Gotcha! I'm actually an English teacher (currently teaching 6th and 12th, but the school has all of k-12) and havent had any issues with it being pulled on by anything other than the occasional door handle. Even the really curious Kindergartner's have been pretty good with leaving it alone, although you will get plenty of questions about what it is lol"
ChronicallyIllBadAss,2022-04-29,1,That is good to know! Thank you!
rattlinsabre,2022-04-29,1,"I have a 4yo and he doesn't pull on the tobing.

ChronicallyIllBadAss,2022-04-29,1,I work with these kiddos so I dont really know how to tell them that I need it and they cant play with it.  But its going to a learning curve for all of us
diabeartes,2022-04-29,1,"I believe omnipod will send you a demo ""dummy"" unit that you can wear to see if you like how it feels without actually hooking it up. 

Personally I found it felt like I had a huge tumor on my arm and went with Animas first and now on Medtronic since unfortunately Animas went out of business. 

However YMMV."
crimsonscyes,2022-05-23,15,"So from what I understand the initial diagnosis is more like a guess from the doctor and then they confirm later on with various tests like the C-peptide test. They probably told you you were type 1 just based on the fact that you had DKA, which is less common with type 2's, and other information you gave them. Did they give you a reference range for your C-peptide test?"
himalayanthro,2022-05-23,1,the reference range was 0.48-5.05(mine was 0.53)
pheregas,2022-05-23,4,"What was your BG at the time the c peptide test was taken?

Some T1s, especially newly diagnosed may have some honeymoon effects. So if your BG was elevated, your body could be trying to do what normal bodies do, which is make insulin.

If youre still in honeymoon, you may be able to get away with metformin for a while, but if T1, once your body is done nuking your islet cells, things will go bad quickly.

As others have mentioned, the antibody tests are the best way to differentiate at this stage."
himalayanthro,2022-05-23,1,"thank you for the reply, I have also been wondering whether i've been on a honeymoon phase since a while.

It was early morning and I hadnt had bf when the blood was extracted for the cpep test, so I guess it wudve been somewhere around 70-80mg/dL at max(I was on insulin at that time and these were the usual levels for that time of the day)

And ya I'll get the antibodies tests done soon enough, thanks!"
pheregas,2022-05-23,2,"Yeah, if you were 70-80 at the time of the test, there'd be zero reason for your body to be producing insulin.

I did have a c-peptide result around yours once, like 20 years after diagnosis, but I was 180 at the time.

Your labs from that date probably say what your BG was.  They almost always run it with everything else."
friendless2,2022-05-23,9,"I am not a doctor, nor do I play one on TV.

With a C-Peptide that low, it is possible to be Type 1 still in honeymoon.  If the C-Peptide drops more, then insulin will be required and T1 confirmation is likely.

Now if you get more C-Peptide tests in the next few months and it stays there, then it is possible to be a Type 2 with low insulin output.  Since you are able to control it with 30/70 quite well, the third doctor may be correct.

I would talk to the endo, and get the additional C-Peptide tests to see how things are progressing.  Not sure why you are switching doctors.  I tend to trust endos over general practitioners. 

Watch for signs of DKA again.  If that happens, you may be confirmed as T1.  

The elevated glucose may be a sign of increased carb consumption or the low insulin output not being enough to handle the glucose levels you have.   There are Type 2 that take insulin too, and you may be one of those.

No definitive answers here."
himalayanthro,2022-05-23,1,"thank you for the reply, I'm also thinking of waiting for a month or two, get my cpeptide tests again and also the antibodies one, and then go back to my endo"
friendless2,2022-05-23,2,"As a 23 year Type 1 with no positive antibody tests, I though I should tell you that you may not have that confirmation.

My C-Peptides are well below normal, so this is T1.

It is also possible to have T1 and T2 (no insulin with high resistance) so there is always another option to consider.  Not that you need more to think about."
himalayanthro,2022-05-23,1,"yours is an interesting case to me then, i was of the impression that antibodies test would always come out as positive in the case of t1d, thanks for sharing

and btw, just as its probable that my cpeptide levels might drop after a few months, is it also probable that the might rather increase in that span?"
friendless2,2022-05-23,2,"It is hard to say.

They could go down if T1, or stay the same if T2."
Kaleandra,2022-05-23,5,"Did either of them test for antibodies?

From what it looks like, doc 1 may have put you on a little too much insulin, but what doc 2 is doing doesn't seem right either. 

You definitely need a confirmation of what type you are. Antibody test should do that."
himalayanthro,2022-05-23,2,no i'm yet to take an antibody test actually. And would an antibody test come out as positive or negative if I have T1D?
Kaleandra,2022-05-23,8,"Positive/ high, if you have antibodies that attack your beta cells."
himalayanthro,2022-05-23,1,"Alright thanks, I'll take that test. Cud u tell what that test is called exactly?"
Kaleandra,2022-05-23,7,GAD-65 is what should be measured. Reference range according to my lab results would have been below 10
crimsonscyes,2022-05-23,4,For the antibody test (GAD test) a high number would indicate type 1 and a low number would indicate type 2. I'd also recommend getting one to be sure.
4thshift,2022-05-23,4,"There are 4 or 5 antibody commonly done tests you can have performed . With your history  very high glucose, high A1C, ketones but not DKA, low insulin output  you certainly have reason to suspect Type 1 autoimmunity. 

Antibodies are produced against parts of your pancreas beta cells  and possibly also against insulin. GAD65 is the most commonly found antibody. If you have more than one antibody, then it is pretty well established that you have Type 1. Some people have just one antibody, and do not get Type 1, so it is a little tricky to say from a single antibody alone.

https://pathologytestsexplained.org.au/learning/test-index/diabetes-auto

Type 1 is autoimmune related loss of beta cells, but you will hear a confusing mix of people saying they are Type 1.5 or LADA or late-onset Type 1. The problem is autoimmunity, regardless of what people believe they have; or if no evidence of autoimmunity, then it is less likely to be Type 1. 

There is a version of Type 2 which has seemingly sudden lack of insulin and high ketones called KPD (sometimes called idiopathic, or even Type 1b) which is real but uncommon. People diagnosed with it may need a lot of insulin at first, and then less or none as they recover from the high glucose.

This new doctor sounds a bit goofy, but that none of them ran antibody tests sounds goofy to me. You were on insulin and doing okay, A1C of 4.6 from 10 is amazing, TBH. A 4.1 after a few days seems weird. I would question the validity of the test  was it from a fingerstick or did they do a blood draw?

Either way, just get antibodies tested. That is probably your real answer. I hope you feel better. If you have antibodies then you definitely need some insulin sooner or later. Metformin is not the right medication if your blood glucose is going up, it would be trying to treat the wrong aspect of your metabolism (insulin sensitivity) rather than the actual cause of high glucose in Type 1 (death of beta cells that produce insulin).

Also, 70/30 mix of insulin is kind of a simplified way to treat people who need insulin. It works okay but doesnt offer a lot of flexibility. You would eventually either move toward 2 separate injections a long acting basal + a fast or rapid insulin for meals and corrections; or you could use a pump which only uses rapid insulin.

As far as age, data suggests Type 1 autoimmunity occurs at any age, and reports will frequently say that diagnosis is usually in children, but that isnt true according to emerging evidence  it is a perpetual assumption, and we have people here who suffered for long periods of time with the wrong diagnosis because of this notion. It happens; doctors are not all the same in their understanding and curiosity."
himalayanthro,2022-05-24,2,"&gt;very high glucose, high A1C, ketones but not DKA

i think you misread it, I did have DKA, i wud always be thirsty and frequently urinating throughout the day

&gt;was it from a fingerstick or did they do a blood draw

from a blood draw but yeah the figures seemed quite suspicious/off to me too, going to get them checked again after a month or so. Thanks!"
4thshift,2022-05-24,2,"Ok, I missed something in there  DKA or not, same process. Sorry you had to go thru it all. I found out just before I got to acidosis. A1C 13.2%. 

With Type 1, theyll say people lose all their ability to make insulin. And thats kind of the idea, but not entirely accurate. Because 1) some patients have the ability to make small amounts of insulin for decades, till their final days, proven by autopsy. 2) loss of beta cells may take several years, and it only becomes apparent at an estimated 80% loss or more. 

So, some newly diagnosed adult T1D get near-perfect glucose control for some months, but it does gradually get harder and more difficult. Still, that 4.6% is what most of us could only dream about."
Sprig3,2022-05-23,3,"Obviously, we can't know for sure (and there's actually not much to really truly prove either way).  And obviously, we can't diagnose over the internet, but....

It definitely sounds like type 1.  550 is incredibly high.  T2 usually presents slowly (slowly getting worse and worse over time).  DKA is incredibly rare for T2.  Additionally, T2's typically have very high C-peptide levels (unless they are experiencing ""pancreas burnout"").

I tested at 0.5 ng/mL on c-peptide about 6 months after diagnosis (the reference range on my test showed as 1.1 -  4.4).  Not sure what units or reference range was for you.

It's actually typical for type 1's to have detectible C-peptide levels for many years after diagnosis, with amounts and rates increasing if you were diagnosed at an older age.

jeffbaier,2022-05-23,3,"get a second opinion, this isn't something to fuck around with"
uniqueoddfellow,2022-05-23,2,"Look into LADA or Type 1.5, especially if you are say, 30+ yrs old. Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults often presents as both t1 and t2..... as my endo said when I got my diagnosis 2 yrs ago at 45y/o"
himalayanthro,2022-05-23,1,"alright i will ask  about it, i'm 24 btw"
WoefulHC,2022-05-23,2,"You've several things at play here:

1. Some doctors see ""over 18"" and conclude, ""must be type 2"". This is, in fact wrong, but they still think/diagnose, prescribe like this. (\~50% of new T1 diagnoses are over 18.) 
2. There are many assumptions that go into converting an a1c into average bg over the last 90 days. The may NOT hold true for you. 
3. The a1c is a time weighted average, this means yesterday has more impact than last week. Last week has more impact than last month. 
4. DKA *is* a pretty solid indicator of T1. I'm pretty sure that was all they used when I was diagnosed in 1976. However, it CAN happen in T2. 
5. Society in general (and many doctors) stigmatize the various types differently. That may very well play into what they diagnose and prescribe. 

Can we tell you which you have? No. Nor should you take medical advice or diagnosis from random strangers on the internet. However, I can say your doctor should run 3 or 4 tests to be able to be confident of the diagnosis. The should ALSO be able to explain how those test tell them which type. If they can't tell you how they reached their conclusion you NEED a different doctor.

Regardless of type, you NEED some formal diabetes education. Many health plans cover such. However, in most such education is NOT suggested. Also regardless of type, you need a care team (including doctor) that views their role as educating and enabling you to treat the disease. You are the one living with it 24/7. They can NOT treat it effectively in 4-6 15-30 minute sessions spread across a year. 

Lastly, getting an accurate diagnosis is important because it suggests which treatment plans are most likely to work. Keep in mind that ""Your Diabetes May Vary"" is a thing. In other words, there is HUGE variability between people even with the same type. There can be similar variability between different days for the same person. 

As others have indicated, it is possible to have both, there are additional types. The real question is, what treatment makes the most sense for you right now? Follow up questions abound, but mostly center around continuing to ask that question and if a change makes sense."

evileyeball,2022-04-29,1,"Excellent. I was Diagnosed at the end of november, My doctor didn't put me on any medication (yet) I was at A1C 9.4. I've lost 30lbs as well and overhauled my diet and exercise Walking over 500km in the time since diagnosis.  
I'm waiting to hear back from the doctor about my last Lab work which I did on the 28th of march. He's a new to me doctor who I have only had since October so I hope he will call regardless of if the outcome of the labs was good or bad  


If I haven't herd back from him soon I am going to call him. I also do plan to go sometime soon here to get set up with the system they have here where you can log in online and view your own lab results . you just have to go into a health authority facility to do the initial setup and I haven't had time to do so."

DiabeticCumshot,2022-05-24,1,No pain whatsoever just randomly got out of the shower after an arm workout and I noticed this. Im thinking the workout caused the bleeding as it was my first time doing a triceps workout while wearing the sensor on my tricep.
matchamorgan,2022-05-24,1,"If this happened after a shower, then its probably bleeding from the day you inserted it seeping into the plaster due to the water, rather than fresh bleeding from the workout - I had this happen to me before and was also a bit freaked out when I first saw it! But I had it checked by my partner (trained nurse) who explained it was unlikely to be fresh blood. I kept mine on and didnt have any issues :)"
DiabeticCumshot,2022-05-24,1,It doesnt seem to be bleeding anymore (as far as I can tell and the sensors reading still seems accurate as I just finger stick tested and numbers were pretty similar) so Im wondering what to do & does the blood being dried up mean Im good to go or do I just remove and replace it because the blood might mess everything up

melancholalia,2022-05-24,2,"it will likely just be a bit of dried blood, not like when a pump site sometimes bleeds when you pull it out (those are fun lol)"
tultamunille,2022-05-24,1,"Gushers are pretty rare, but definitely worth the ride! lol 

Seriously though, they dont happen that often, usually with Omnipod only. 

Dexcom for me will have some dried blood from time to time, I look at it as a sort of badge of honor at this point. Haha gotta find some fun in the grind! 

Sure beats testing 8 or more times a day like I did for so many years. And yours looks ok compared to what I will see occasionally, which is a little more blood dried under the tape. Pretty rare to see much blood when changing sites, if at all."
renmibi,2022-05-24,1,"This is quite common in my experience, and about 1 in 10 sensors for me end up with a little bleeding. I have always left mine in, except for a couple of times when it was too painful and I had no choice but to pull it out. Both times, Dexcom agreed to send me a replacement when I asked.  Also, it is probably a good idea to wipe the whole area around the sensor with an alcohol prep pad to reduce chance of infection."

BKCowGod,2022-05-05,1,"My case manager (in my situation she is a PharmD) is very pleased with my control and wants me to actually be a bit higher on average and have fewer lows. 

I could have tighter control but I value an unrestricted diet over a more closely managed glucose level. 

One thing to know is that it took me a decade of significant effort to get to this point. Getting to know my body to the point where I can usually guess my glucose level based on symptoms, getting to know my responsiveness to insulin and carbs and exercise and all of the other [42 factors](https://diatribe.org/42-factors-affect-blood-glucose-surprising-update), and especially understanding that there is no shame in going high or low sometimes. Once every few weeks I take my data and chart it on a spreadsheet. This sheet plots it against my basal, carb ratio, and correction factor. From here I fine tune my profile in my insulin pump. Diabetes is a living, breathing thing and it changes over days and weeks. 

I honestly think a lot of why it is perhaps easier for me is because of my background modifying and playing with cars. Insulin pumps and their interaction with the body are a lot like engines. You have to have the right mix of fuel, air, and spark to make ideal power. I have spent so many years customizing fuel maps and distributor curves that some of this is second nature to me."

I also suffer from cyclical vomiting syndrome, which may or may not have anything to do with diabetes. So this is what has happened to me after many (10+) years of high blood sugars."
GillyGoose1,2022-05-06,3,"I do feel the need to say this - I'm sorry that you're going through all of that. I've been diabetic for 23 years and never experienced any of the issues you have with it. Some of us are just luckier than others I guess but all the same, I really feel awful on your behalf.

The good news is, the triple transplant (specifically, the pancreas) should result in you no longer being diabetic? I'm pretty sure that's what I've read in regards to it, I could be wrong! But if it's true then you'll finally get the break you deserve from this awful illness. I wish you the best of luck for the future!"
YourJewishLandlord,2022-05-06,5,Sadly your anti bodies will attack the beta cells on the new pancreas. Not even immunosuppressants will help. Will put you in the honey moon phase again tho.
DoEsNtReAlLyMaTtErD,2022-05-06,3,These are the numbers Ive had from my surgeon team- 9 out of 10 donor pancreases are working after 1 year. Around 8 out of 10 are still working after 5 years.
YourJewishLandlord,2022-05-06,1,Whats the maximum amount of time someones gone  before all the beta cells are dead?
DoEsNtReAlLyMaTtErD,2022-05-06,2,In their experience 16 years in the longest. But whenever it happens you they can chose to go back on the transplant list or on insulin. But these are only data from my team in Oxford. Theres less than a handful of hospitals who specialise in kidney-pancreas transplant in the entire country. And Im sure each area will have a little difference in their results.

Rhian713,2022-05-06,3,"33 years with diabetes. Poor to terrible control in my early twenties. I cannot express to you the pain of lying awake at night, feeling like your feet are stuck in a blast furnace. Not being able to wear shoes because the compression of tying your laces makes it feel like they are in a vice. The brush of the hem of your pants feeling like your foot is being cut into with a serrated blade. And that's just the neuropathy.
I almost lost my right eye to retinopathy. Thankfully surgery was able to save it. Got both eyes lasered which was an intensely uncomfortable experience. Unfortunately it is very difficult to read now without getting headaches.
My body can't cool down when it gets too hot and can't warm up when it gets to cold because of all the damage I did to the circulation in my extremities. Makes doing exercise extremely difficult and sometimes dangerous due to risk of overheating. I have a hard time stringing my thoughts together when I am tired and I am not as mentally capable as I was before. I have organ damage pretty much everywhere.
Hospitalized multiple times for DKA and a number of reoccurring infections so bad that I was delusional on a few occasions. 
High blood sugars make you tired, hungry and thirsty.
If you have blood sugars that don't come down, call your doctor or go to the emergency room. If you have to insulin ration, eat a diet high in lean meats and vegetables without starches (no carrots, potatoes, etc.) so the food won't hit your blood sugar as hard. Drink a shit ton of water to help dilute all the sugar your kidneys are trying to clear out.
I sincerely hope you find the help you need to bring yourself back into control. If you need help, feel free to reach out. I don't know about the medical systems in other countries, but I am old hat at dealing with the dumpster fire the US has for a healthcare system."
Warpig777,2022-05-06,4,"High BG levels don't have any apparent short term effects. What you need to be aware of, is that the longer you let your diabetes go unchecked, the more irreversible damage you'll be doing to your body, and pancreas.

The part about the pancreas is very important if you want to reverse your diabetes. When treated early, T2 diabetes can be reversed. The how effective it can be reversed depends on how much damage you've done to your beta cells that create insulin. The sooner you heal yourself, the more close to normal you can recover.

Knowing this, it's important to start your treatment now. Not with drugs, but with diet and exercise. Yes, diabetes can be completely put into remission without medication! Starting now, you must make an effort to avoid processed carbs. No sugar, bread, pasta, rice, or potatoes. Vegetable carbs are free. You can have as many vegetables as you want. This might sound daunting, but it's not as hard as it seems.

Construct your meals with a protein and a vegetable. You cannot go wrong using this method. I've been doing this diet combined with 4-5 days per week exercising, and in only 3 months I've almost completely reversed my T2 diagnosis. My A1c went from 6.9 to 5.7. My weight dropped by 23 pounds and counting. This is all without any medication BTW. 

And for the record, I've been far from perfect with my diet. I did have the occasional cake, ice cream, or cola, but my meals are more carefully planned. If I do have a carb for one meal, I'll make sure the next one is carb free. Or if I do have rice or potatoes, the portions will be much smaller than they used to be. The more you practice eating well, the easier it becomes, and the less you'll want to cheat yourself. 

Read a book called **The Diabetes Code, by Dr. Jason Fung**. It will set you on the right path to taking control of your diabetes, and more than likely will reverse your diagnosis.

My life changed 4 months ago when I was diagnosed with T2 diabetes. I had no idea what to do about it. I had no idea how to grocery shop anymore. All I knew, was that the only way to fix it, was with diet. The path through medical treatment does not work! You have to take control of your diet!

Start by reading the book I suggested, and you will recover! Good luck."

saltycupcakes,2022-05-10,1,"Would you mind giving some examples about the protein in these cases? Like a typical daily plan.

Do you mean like eating chicken for breakfast, pork chops for lunch, bacon for dinner etc? Wha about snacks?"
Warpig777,2022-05-10,1,"I am eating two meals (lunch and dinner) a day, with a coffee w/cream in the morning. I was using a 16/8 fasting protocol, but I miss my morning coffee w/cream and it doesn't seem to slow my results down any.

I eat my two meals still using the fasting schedule I was before (lunch at 1pm, dinner by 9pm), and I don't snack in between them. I'm trying to limit how much food processing my body does in a day, and snacking interrupts that. When I do occasionally snack, it's something like a handful of walnuts or almonds, or a piece of string cheese.

I try to prep my work lunches every Sunday. This way I can concentrate on making it extra healthy, and then I only have to worry about making dinner the rest of the week. Some examples of prepped lunches I use are: Pot roast w/veggies, a variety of chicken crockpot meals, porkchops w/veggies, basically any kind of meat accompanied with a veggie is fair game to me (I need to eat more fish). Dinners are the same principle. Also, when I have a fatty meat with one meal, I try to balance it out with a leaner meat for the next one. 

On active weekends when I go mountain biking, I do have a breakfast. It's something simple like bacon and eggs, or an omelette packed with cheese and veggies.

My vegetables can be anything from fresh to frozen to canned. I avoid canned veggies the most, but will use them in a crunch. Frozen veggies are always super convenient and easy to make.

This plan accompanied with 4-5 days per week of exercise has really changed me for the better. I'm still losing weight, and I wonder just how far it will go. I'm never feeling like I'm starving myself, and I literally eat just as much food as I was before I changed my diet, it's just better foods!"
suchahotmess,2022-05-06,2,"Since you asked specifically about mental health impact and most of the responses here are looking at physical - 

There are a lot of negative mental health outcomes associated with diabetes, although a lot of them seem to be associated with the diagnosis or symptoms rather than the result of the disease itself. Depression, anxiety, eating disorders, etc - things that it sounds like youre already struggling with.

There is also increased risk of dementia and cognitive impairment, with dementia risk increasing even with prediabetes, as you alluded to in your post."

ClayWheelGirl,2022-05-06,1,"what do you mean by high? 150 at fasting n then higher? what medications are you on? any insulin? are you seeing an endo. how long ago were you diagnosed and has the numbers come down since your diagnosis.

the thing is diabetes is a range and it differs from body to body. for instance a high for me is 160. that means according to my medical staff my highs are others lows.when i get to 160 to 170 my body shuts down. extreme fatigue, woolly brain, blurred vision and i cannot hold a conversation - i nod off. its written in my charts to go to the ER if ive tried to lower my sugar but it keeps going up at 240. the moment i pass 200 i get extreme nausea n throw up. 

here is my mothers story. typical yo yo diabetes for 50+ years. month 1 after a1c she is strict, month 2 not so strict, month 3 really let loose but not go overboard. then she does her A1c omg! cycle begins again! she has always been on metformin - no insulin n she does take her medications regularly. the only time she had a health issue was when she didnt realize she had an infected abscess on her back n her bs one morning was 16. she lives alone n her neighbors found her. plus cataracts in both eyes that were fine after surgery.

she has also had high cholesterol, scared of living alone, some paranoia but otherwise doing well.

if you are doing your bit, controlling stress, weight, sleep, drinking water, diet n exercise n STILL have high nos. i would be hounding your dr. there needs to be more investigation as to why ur body is responding the way it is. are you not getting the right medication? in todays world of medicine that should not be happening.

do you have support?

now my theory. we diabetics ive noticed have one thing in common (of course there are exceptions). we are all worriers, or perfectionists or planners. we always want to know the next step. not healthy at all. i know thats true for me. for me its not diet that matters but sleep n stress. after a bad nights rest or high stress a normal meal that barely usually spikes me, can spike me sky high.

our bodies are amazing. ive been close to death a few times (new diabetic here) - idiopathic- n recovered really fast too. so many times my family has been warned to prepare for the worst n ive walked out unscathed.

ive had chronic cough (mainly pollution) for the past 40 years. when the covid lockdown happened, my cough went away never to return!

my point is there is something for spirit. my best friend was diagnosed with advanced breast cancer in her mid 20s. she finally passed away at 45. her drs n nurses marveled how she made the last 10 years. it was a miracle they said. she should have died at 30 when the cancer spread to all parts of her body. she used to tell us - hey no long faces. im not going to die soon. but the last year of her life she said her goodbyes. she said she wasnt sure if shed get to see 2021. she drove around week before she died. early december just before her 46th birthday. she was at the TG table but wasnt able to eat much.

life is a mystery. keep your spirits high. everything depends on that. however i understand. that is a high demand in this world even for me!"
KokoPuff12,2022-05-06,1,"I have always have a1cs at 7.1 or below.  I didn't always have a CGM, so some of those a1cs that were in the 6es likely had some big swings in blood glucose.

All_Hail_King_Sheldn,2022-05-19,25,"Since you don't have a doctor, you NEED to get one. The only insulin products that you can reliably get OTC (without a prescription) is the old school NPH and R, and it is quite dangerous to use them without constant medical guidance, a strict diet regimen, and very importantly Consistency in the dose timing and meal timing. 

Also note; since you were just diagnosed, there is a change that you will be right back where you are now in a couple of months. It is not unusual at all for the first diagnoses typing (especially when done on an adult at a hospital) to be incorrect. You may very well be 1.5/LADA or type 1, and that is going to need more testing to be sure. 


&amp;nbsp; 

Now on to how to get the medicine you need. There are several options you can follow. First up; assuming 

&gt; I recently stopped working due to complications after pregnancy. 

means you had a child, then you are qualified to receive medicaid coverage in most states, as is the child. If you have no work, and no safety net, there is also a good chance you can get on SNAP or WIC as well, which can help. Take all you required documents to the city or county services building and apply for them. Make sure you keep a detailed record of every step of the process, because it is not uncommon for these offices to be as competent as a dead horse at their jobs. 

&amp;nbsp; 

Next up, find a community clinic in your area. They are sometimes listed as the free clinic. Most will see anyone, especially if you can provide documents (proof of address and a bank statement usually) stating your need. 

&amp;nbsp;

Lastly, See if you can get on Basaglar instead of Lantus. If you can get that script changed, then you can go [HERE](https://www.insulinaffordability.com/?returnType=cash#paycash) and click ""If You Pay In Cash""  (this means you are uninsured), and print teh card. Take both the prescription (ENSURE that your prescription is written in such a way that 1500u is 1 month, if not, you WILL be charged for x months per box, i.e. if your script is for 750u/month, you will be charged for 2 months, if your script is for 500u/month, your will pay for 3 months, etc) to the pharmacy of your choice. When it is ready,  you pay $35/month for your long acting insulin."

If you can't find a listing online, I recommend calling like  a United Way 311 line or the local health department to see if they have recommendations.

You may also want to see if you can sign up for health insurance through [healthcare.gov](https://healthcare.gov) if you have a qualifying life event and I think job loss is one. Also see if you qualify for Medicaid for at least the duration of your pregnancy. My state has recently expanded Medicaid to include people caught in the gap like this."

NPH and R-type insulin are much cheaper at close to $20 per vial last I looked if you but it at Walmart. You also dont need a prescription to get it in the vast majority of states though the pharmacy will not advertise this. Having said that these insulin types cannot be just substituted for the insulin you were prescribed so make sure you know what youre doing.

You absolutely need a doctor, unfortunately, though some clinics will likely see you for cheap or for free. Ask around. Its just that youll eventually need refills and you probably need your prescriptions adjusted."

I make our morning oatmeal with at least 0.5-1 egg per portion, plus hemp, ground chia, and a few servings of collagen powder. The added protein &amp; fat reduces the amount of carbs we need to feel full from oatmeal by about 25%. (This would work less well if you also need to bolus for fat and/or protein like some people do.)

I also do ""pumpkin pancakes"" that are mostly egg, flaxseed, pumpkin puree, and a tiny bit of flour for binding (I've subbed flour for a serving of Vega One unflavored before; it gets sticky and thick after sitting for a bit). They have about half the carbs as my ""oatmeal with eggs"".

It needs more stirring as it cooks to thoroughly mix the eggs, and then it gets a slightly more custard-y texture. If I don't extra stir, we get a few tiny bits of scrambled egg mixed into the oatmeal.

You could also try baked oatmeal with an extra egg or two than the recipe calls for, and maybe add some protein powder as the ""flavour"".

02_Lens-Hood,2022-05-14,2,"If you are interested in something savory:
Start with a defrosted 2/3c of cauliflower rice. I use the plain frozen version from Whole Foods, and it is easy to find similar products else where.

Then I add about 1/3c of broiled veggies that I prepared in advance: I use Brussel sprouts or green beans, or broccoli.  I just broil these up on a platter with a little olive oil and salt/pepper until they brown up. Then store the broiled veggies in the fridge, they will last around a week. 

At breakfast time I mix the cauliflower rice and the veggies, and microwave the mix (2 min) or bake it to your taste, with a little more spices if you wish. I cant do cheese but that might work as well. Thats it, enjoy your low carb, low cal meal!"

DiabeticSockClub,2022-05-13,0,"One way to achieve a better blood sugar level is to follow a low-carb diet that is why it is good and helpful for people with Diabetes. With Diabetes, your body can't fully process or break down the carbs you eat. Normally, when you eat carbs, they are broken down into small units of glucose that end up spiking up your blood sugar. 

If you have type 1 diabetes, the strongest way to reduce the symptoms and complications is to count the carbs of the foods you will eat, also known as ""carb counting."" Carb counting is the most effective approach to control blood sugar levels; this implies that the amount of insulin you take must correspond to the number of carbs in your meal, snack, or drink. Here are some ideas for a breakfast meal if you have type 1 diabetes:

-Baked eggs with two slices of rye bread 

-Porridge with 30g porridge oats, 200ml almond milk, 40g blueberries, and 10g pumpkin seeds

-Omelet with mushrooms and spring onions 

-Smoothie with summer berries for breakfast

-Baked eggs with two slices of rye bread

-Welsh leek rarebit

-Two eggs and milk omelets with 80 grams of spinach, 80 grams of mushrooms, one teaspoon of vegetable oil, and 25 grams of shredded cheddar. Serve with a rye bread slice slathered in unsaturated margarine.

FriedGreenTomatoSoup,2022-05-05,3,Our insurance wont cover it. Ugh.
buzzybody21,2022-05-05,4,Mine either. Mine wont even cover the dash. Im expecting zero.
fintem,2022-05-05,3,"Yup. I went through this process recently figuring I would use the dash until the 5 comes out, but my insurance doesn't cover it. God knows when they would cover the 5. I went with the tandem instead. That was 100% covered by my insurance."
bigbeardbigheart,2022-05-05,1,"Wow that's incredible. Mine is the reverse. The tandem is covered but only by DME. And I would need to pay my deductible first, then insurance would cover 70%. So pretty trash lol. All of my supplies the following year would be completely out of pocket. But luckily omnipod is covered under my pharmacy benefit"
bigw86,2022-05-06,1,Who you have? I have Blue Cross Blue Shield Texas and they didnt cover it last year when I tried getting on it even though I was on it for the year prior with a different company. So I had to go back to the old one.
buzzybody21,2022-05-06,2,"I have BCBS of CT. They only cover the Eros, and have told me they have no intention of covering upgrades to the Eros."
bigw86,2022-05-07,2,"My only saving grace is while my fiancé just started a new job and has BCBS as well, I dont believe shes stuck with Caremark. I gotta find out what pharmacy insurance she has and then see if they cover this stuff. We get married in November so if I can get it by then hopefully its be on a full release."
bigw86,2022-05-07,1,Fuckers. Im going to be really pissed off if I cant get the new one. Dash isnt that big of a loss since I had it until I got BCBS but this new one is a game changer and I definitely want to be on it.
anideainloss,2022-05-19,2,"Who is your PBM? Im on BCBS TX and Im covered for Dash when we had express scripts and this year they went with prime therapeutics as the PBM and dash still covered but not OP5.

Edit:
Read further and saw you have Caremark. Sorry for not reading all the way"
bigw86,2022-05-19,1,Funny you mention Prime. My fiancé has BCBS NJ and their PBM is Prime. You sure the 5 isnt covered because I did a dummy order on Amazon Pharmacy which is one of the online pharmacies she can use and it was a $20 copay for 3 month supply according to Amazon for the OmniPod 5. It was also $20 for Dexcom G6 supposedly.
Walter_unpigmented,2022-05-19,2,I want to remind everyone that you have to fight for yourself and your rights.  The omnipod 5 and any other pump with automatic adjustments are real tangible improvements to health.  All insurance formularies can be changed and you can petition for you insurance to cover the omniopd 5.  I started emailing my companies benefits team 18 months ago to make sure they understood that both Omnipod and Dexcom wanted their new products in the pharmacy channel only.  I did this not only for my daughter to get the Omnipod 5 as soon as possible but hopefully others that maybe don't have the time or the means to push back against a strictly for profit medical system.
Kathw13,2022-05-05,3,"Have you tried using your pharmacy benefits?  Im covered through Caremark/CVS.  I would also contact who administers your insurance plan (not the insurance agency, but one level above that)."
bigw86,2022-05-06,1,I have Caremark too and was told Im not covered. Wtf. My main insurance is Blue Cross Blue Shield does it matter what the main insurance is if its a pharmacy benefit? Shouldnt it just go through CVS then?
Kathw13,2022-05-06,2,"That is crazy.  I have BCBS of Texas / Caremark.   You should go up one higher on the insurance ladder and ask for it. 

Several years ago I was upset that CGMS wasnt covered. I went up the ladder and complained to the person who is in charge of picking those parts of the plan and CGMs was covered soon after.  And it has been covered since at a cheap rate.  Come to find out that person had a Type 1 child and my call prompted her to investigate it."
bigw86,2022-05-06,1,Which one do I deal with though? BCBS or Caremark?
Kathw13,2022-05-07,2,"Have you gone to the Caremark website and did a medication search for Omnipod?  I just did, and found the new Omnipod on it.  Im tempting to ask my endo for it and see when it comes, but I have just settled into using Ozempic / Farziga/ Fiasp with an InPen.  Since I just got the newest InPen, that would be rude ;)

Im Type 2, have lost over 100 pounds and am hoping to get off of insulin."
bigw86,2022-05-10,2,"So my fiancé has Horizon BCBS and her pharmacy benefits are done through Prime Therapeutics. I did a search for drugs through their website and looks like they cover OmniPod 5 as its listed with pricing. I also have the ability to use Amazon Pharmacy AND it looks like Im not restricted to any single pharmacy like I am through Caremark/CVS. 

I wont be married until November but at least it looks like Ill be able to get on the OmniPod 5."
bigw86,2022-05-07,1,No I didnt realize I could even do that. Ill see if I can figure it out. Thanks!
bigw86,2022-05-07,1,I just did the search and none of the OmniPods listed on the site are covered. They even have the new one listed already.
Kathw13,2022-05-07,1,"You need to go above both, thats what I did.  There is a person  probably in your Human Resources department, that picks what goes into your plan.  I dont know how that works exactly on the marketplace but there has to be someone who does that."
Mo-Cuishle,2022-05-06,2,"I work at Insulet, though not in a function that really has anything to do with customer product availability. My understanding is that Omnipod 5 is currently in a ""limited release"" phase. It only received FDA clearance in January so Insulet is still working out expanding patient availability. There's a lot that goes in to getting adequate stock out to suppliers for a new product these days, just look at graphics cards or new cars! Carrier stock/availability will only improve as the year goes on.

Tl;dr: it's coming"
babysnowflake,2022-05-06,1,"From what i hear plans and pharmacies most likely to cover it are cigna and humana but of course it varies, with CVSCaremark and I think express scripts. It takes a while for insurance companies and pharmacies to get on board when new stuff comes out I think"

blazblu82,2022-05-20,3,"Have you been able to work any? SSDI needs a certain amount of work credit to qualify. I'm 39 and working on getting low-vision disability due to prolific retinopathy. Can't drive anymore and haven't been able to work since last November due to the complications from the disease. Finished the last step of the process 2 weeks ago and now waiting for a decision.

DogKnowsBest,2022-05-20,2,"What are you doing/taking for your neuropothy?

B-Complex daily has helped me tremendously."
pancreaticallybroke,2022-05-20,9,"Pip isn't based on what condition you have. It's based on how much your condition impacts your daily life and your ability to do what would be classed as normal behaviours. Whilst there's no doubt that diabetes impacts your daily life massively, most diabetics can still do all the normal daily activities.

In the UK, diabetes is legally classed as a disability but it's not permanently or severely disabling unless you have complications or other health issues."
Bear0417,2022-05-20,3,"Yep, I cant do most things. Neuropathy affects my arms and legs, I cant even brush my hair without my arms being in agony. Folding the washing is also a daily struggle too. The system is so fucked, anything to rinse more money out of you =D."
lost-dragonist,2022-05-20,4,Maybe you can reapply based on the neuropathy instead of the diabetes?  It sounds silly but our medical system does this stuff all the time.
toatenein,2022-05-21,1,"Australia is similar, diabetes can't be the primary disease, but many of its complications could qualify someone for support. This is especially true if the complication makes managing diabetes extremely difficult without support  e.g. vision changes making it difficult to read monitors, neuropathy making it hard to inject / test."
slickgingerdaddy,2022-05-21,2,"I need to reapply for PiP but I have been accepted for work incapacity with universal credit, however I have to mention this.  


When I applied for PiP (twice now in the last 2 years) they have declined based off my diabetic conditions in terms of neuropathy, retinopathy...  


Work incapacity accepted my approval based purely on my mental health. I suffer from severe depression to the extreme point I unfortunately took an overdose.  


Based on mental health grounds they accepted my claim and did NOT even bother to note my diabetic conditions which are the main cause for my mental health side.  


The UK system is so weird."
Bear0417,2022-05-20,1,"also cant cook most days (as my legs are sore just after 5 mins of standing) but as long as I can put a ding dong meal in the micro im good to go of course!!! =5=«"

TechnicalPyro,2022-05-20,2,"In canada its based on how much time you spend a week dealing with diabetes.  I was lucky enough that my endo was willing to do the paperwork and as of last year do not need to renew it every 5 years now

QuiJon70,2022-05-20,2,"I dont know about uk but in america our disability through social security essentially turns down everyone. Requiring you to go through appeals until eventually a hearing. Whole process took almost 2 years for me to finally get to a judge that in a 5 minute hearing declared me disabled.

My best suggestion is if available get a lawyer. Again here in america they have laws on what they can charge to hand look e a case and most lawyers wont take the case if they don tf think they can win which is another good indication if fighting it is worth your time."
toatenein,2022-05-21,2,"I'm sorry that you're dealing with so much at the moment.

I think just for clarity, car insurance is hiked up for diabetics because we are a high-risk driver, in that if we are hypoglycemic when behind the wheel we are as dangerous as a drunk driver. But in regards to qualifying for disability, hypoglycemia while a daily risk, is not a frequent enough occurrence to severely impair functioning.

To put it into perspective, quite a number of the people who qualify for PIP probably aren't legally allowed to drive, even if they were charged a much higher premium for their insurance."
tomytronics,2022-05-21,2,"I am deaf since birth and I qualified for Social Security for the disabled. (SSI to be exact). I'm also immunocompromised and require a $5,000+ monthly infusion to avoid ending up in hospital.

When I was diagnosed as diabetic, I let the folks at SS know about this since diabetes are usually permanent.  No change in my SSI even though I am paying more out of pocket for stuff not covered by Medicare and Medicaid."
zerofoxxgiven,2022-05-21,2,"I tell the government as little as they need to know about my diabetes. It only makes things worse, not better. I have lived with this for a decade, I know the proper precautions to take while driving."
cyniclawl,2022-05-21,2,Wait are we supposed to tell the DMV/car insurance we're diabetic?
SgtSloth,2022-05-21,2,I actually have a bit to say on this. I am on disability. Without it I would 100% be dead. But it is also miserable. I have a lot of mixed feelings about this stuff. I could write a short novel about it at this point.
Th4n4n,2022-05-21,2,Is this in America? I worked car insurance for a long time and no question we asked would have anything to do with diabetes
Bear0417,2022-05-21,1,"In the uk! I dont drive as of yet as Im too nervous, but was looking into getting my drivers license next year/end of next year as Im looking to get myself back out and working again. So was just having a nosey at things. I remember when I was looking when I was 17 and insurance was still high then. 
Im not fussed about the PIP if Im being honest (I dont actually receive any benefits) its just the double standards(?) really. Like oh we cant give you money because youre not disabled enough then on the other hand its oh youll need to give us money because youre disabled. WHAT?!? =="
Th4n4n,2022-05-21,1,"That's interesting! In America life insurance asks health related questions, but car insurance can only ask demographic questions. Rates can vary wildly between men and women, age, and where you live, but they can't ask about things like health"
Bear0417,2022-05-21,1,Oh right! Yeah in the uk Im pretty sure you have to let them know about any medical conditions (dont quote me on that though!) but there was a space to tick diabetes while I was doing it!
NuttyDounuts14,2022-05-21,2,"Because we can wash, dress and cook for ourselves. Basically, if you can work and get around, you get denied PIP.

I have 4 chronic conditions and when I applied I said ""it's not any individual condition, it's how they all interact and set each other off. My attendance record at work is attrocious because of how often it happens"" and I still only scored 1 point.

The PIP system is designed to deny people.

My nan is 79 in December, has had both hips replaced, severe asthma and arthritis. She can't even get DLA.

All the government have done by trying to stop people from playing the system is make it impossible for those that need help to get it"
CatFaerie,2022-05-19,4,"It's not going to improve your blood sugars by itself, but it might indirectly effect them.

For instance, if you have a lot of pain and are inactive because of it, marijuana may help with the pain and enable you to be more active, which will help with your diabetes.

Diabetes is not the only endocrine disease out there, perhaps this is meant more for people with different conditions. Or maybe this is only intended to raise revenue, and has little relevance to endocrinology."
fuck_you__shoresy,2022-05-19,6,I honestly had to stop using MMJ because the side effects (munchies) were absolutely fuuuuucking up my blood sugar. Not sure what other kind of effect it has on anything though. It didnt seem to do anything
cheech-wizard,2022-05-19,1,That would have been my thought. No way munchies can be good for BG.
fuck_you__shoresy,2022-05-19,2,Yeah I have self control issues x1000 when I get stoned and the best strains for my particular issue happened to be high THC. Recipe for disaster
MysticMarbles,2022-05-19,2,Wanna know when I got high? It's ALL the *HI* readings on my graph. Haha.
DiabeticCumshot,2022-05-19,2,"Munchies dont affect everyone, the more you smoke the less likely you are to experience munchies. Also smoking after you eat helps as munchies doesnt necessarily just make you hungry it makes your hunger more intense so if youre not hungry when youre smoke you should be fine"
Pitiful-Pension-849,2022-05-20,1,"This was a big problem for me but I switched to a new product (higher CBD, less THC) and now its much better. Not sure if its actually bc of that or if Ive gained more self-control but its manageable now. Before I was eating everything in my damn house."
bionic_human,2022-05-19,3,"There's a decent body of anecdotal evidence that it can have some positive effects. Unfortunately, the ""Schedule I"" status severely limits any serious research, so there's a dearth of high-quality peer-reviewed data.

Dr. Jeremy Pettus (Endocrinologist at UCSD, TCOYD Type 1 Track Director, and T1D himself) recently got a grant and clearance to actually do a clinical study in T2D to look for metabolic effects, so we may actually finally get some data on the issue in the near future. The biggest potential issue is that from my understanding, they're going to be using the low-potency ""government weed"" in the study, which may limit the effects and therefore any conclusions that can be drawn. The study was originally supposed to use dronabinol (THC pills), but the funders nixed that. (I actually helped with some of the background research for the grant application).

Personally, I think that it probably has indirect effects via mediation of inflammation and/or other pathways that slightly increase non-insulin-mediated glucose uptake, but that's just a hypothesis."
Rutlant,2022-05-19,2,It has helped me with my pain from neuropathy but youd need to be careful because of the munchies unless youre good at covering yourself. Very dangerous slope.

PM_ME_YOUR_DND_SHEET,2022-05-19,2,"Asked my doctor and nurse practitioner about Marijuana use when I was newly diagnosed with type 2. The biggest thing both mentioned were to watch out for overeating after smoking, especially carbs.

Some people have noticed it lowers bg levels and others have said it raises them. I don't notice a difference but I don't test before or during, and don't wear a CGM. So just be aware it may affect you a little bit in either direction, but I've mostly heard about it slightly lowering bg levels. This does not mean that weed should be used in response to high bg levels as treatment for spikes.

4thshift,2022-05-19,1,"Well just have to wait for the science to waft in sooner or later.

bionic_human,2022-05-19,2,"&gt; Which to believe? Or maybe it is patient-specific?

I'd bet on the latter. T1D doesn't grant immunity from insulin resistance. On the whole, though- for anyone with more than mild-to-moderate insulin resistance, metformin is basically a spitball being shot at an elephant."

AutisticEngineer420,2022-05-19,1,"I have heard from other diabetics that it can lower blood sugar, and in my experience (T1) I think it does. Not that much though so you really need to focus mainly on diet anyway and/or get some kind of medication.

ToffeeCoffee,2022-05-10,8,"HbA1c is your average for last 3 months, so 9 would indicate diabetes.  But you'd need to query your doc for any follow up questions. 

Also if you're on a low carb diet, your fasting and even post prandial BG etc, will all look mostly normal, because you're eating very little carbs. That's doesn't mean you're not diabetic or pre-diabetic. That is in fact one of the goals of a low carb diet, to get your BG back in range."

Some medical conditions can cause a false high on the A1C - anemia, kidney disease/failure, extremely high triglycerides, injury to or removal of part of the spleen, getting a blood transfusion, etc.

It usually takes 2 consecutive A1C tests &gt;6.5% to confirm diabetes. So you could wait until 3 months after the last test &amp; have it tested again or you could go to an endo &amp; get a fructosamine blood test done."
PM_ME_YOUR_DND_SHEET,2022-05-10,3,"An A1C of 9 is diabetic. I was a 9.5 at my diagnosis. I cannot say with any certainties of why you have become diabetic, but the two major factors are: genetics and lifestyle. 

Unfortunately there is no turning back. You can get your A1C back on track, and your pancreas can continue to work for a long long time (and you may never need to go on insulin- you never know), but you will always have diabetes now. Managing your carb intake will become important.

Your A1C tells the story of your blood glucose over the past 3 months in their entirety (with the last month being a bit more important) which says that your blood glucose was consistently high during those times.

Managing through diet alone can work for some people, but I will say the Metformin has helped me. Aside from some unpleasant stomach issues, it's been great at helping me control my levels. It's not for everyone, but it works, and they have an extended release version if the initial digestive issues don't stop or become unbearable.

It sucks, welcome to the club."

aidoru_2k,2022-05-25,1,"Not only it is scientifically proven, but many of us have first-hand experience with it which our CGM graphs can confirm. 

When I have tricky/unpleasant work meetings or I have to address a last-minute issue in a rush my BG shoots up every single time, even by 80-100 mg/dl in half an hour: I know for sure that there is no correlation to food and otherwise I have my basal rate figured out quite nicely at this point, thanks to Control IQ.

JellyTulpa,2022-05-25,1,Exactly. Which means it pumps a ton of glucose into the bloodstream so you have the energy required for fight or flight. Except it can't differentiate if it's the sort of stress where your muscles actually need glucose for a sprint or a wrestle with a predator Vs sitting in a meeting with a bunch of passive aggressive middle managers (or in a dentist chair).

LordRiverknoll,2022-05-06,3,"Let me further support your reconsiderations. I worked in Northern Spain for two years. There as a diabetic, I noticed that the only benefit America had was the wider availability and price of (uninsured) test strips. I imagine this goes back to the fact that tech is typically cheaper in the US. 

Other than that, I would have stayed in Spain if given the chance. I even had to use an ambulance while there (surfing accident). Had I been in the US, I would have been expected to pay tens of thousands more than the cab fare home (my only expense in that six-stitch adventure).

What I'm trying to say, however poorly, is that the European model is simply superior than America's. You would sorely miss it, as the system here is designed to get as money money from those with chronic illnesses as possible.

Even if you're coming from elsewhere in the world, the fact I am honestly scared to go back to an endocrinologist after three years ($$$) should speak for itself."

ellzray,2022-05-20,12,"Lots of gray areas and overlap with people, but in general... T1 (autoimmune) is the immune system attacking the pancreas cells that produce insulin, resulting in low insulin levels.  T2 produce insulin, but there bodies can't use the insulin effectively.  This is referred to as Insulin Resistance.  A lot of T2's have elevated levels of insulin.  Since the cells aren't using the insulin to lower the blood sugar, the body makes more of it. 

T1's can also have issues with insulin resistance, and T2 can end up damaging your pancreas if uncontrolled, leading to T1 issues.  

It's just a big ol' bag fun all around ;)"

amdaly10,2022-05-20,2,"Yes.  The problem isn't the amount of insulin, it's that the insulin doesn't work.  

The best analogy I have heard is that your cells need sugar to function and insulin is the key that unlocks the door to let the sugar into the cell.  But with T2 all your locks are rusty and so the keys don't work very well.  Your body thinks that the doors won't unlock so it should make more keys.  But more keys don't help it's the locks that are broken.  So now you have tons of insulin in your blood and also tons of sugar that can't get into the cells....and then the sugar gets restless and starts breaking things."
confusedb0dy,2022-05-20,1,Thats a great analogy! Thank you!
ForensicClams,2022-05-20,1,"T1 is little or no insulin. T2 starts with higher-than-normal insulin levels and insulin resistance, and probably everybody with prediabetes in early on the continuum of t2. At diagnosis, people with t2 usually still have higher-than-normal insulin, but their insulin resistance gets worse (and their insulin production can deteriorate but still be above normal) and the high insulin levels can't compensate anymore to keep glucose normal - it's considered ""relative"" insufficient insulin rather than ""absolute"" insufficiency because the insulin is not sufficient to keep blood sugar normal even though there is more insulin than normal. People with t2 can eventually lose beta cell function, and then their insulin levels will get low."

4MuddyPaws,2022-05-20,1,"Type 2's hallmark generally is insulin resistance. At least in early stages, the pancreas is producing enough insulin but the cells are not opening to use it properly.  This is often exacerbated, but not necessarily caused by, being overweight.  

Even type 2 seems to have a genetic component and that's why you see many o ereeight people who do not develop diabetes."
manub22,2022-05-20,1,"T2D - pancreas makes less insulin, thus the sugar in blood is consumed very less by the cells, resulting in high BG or hyperglycemia. In this case you take meds like metformin so that your pancreas is forced to generate more/enough insulin.

T1D - pancreas makes no insulin, thus sugar in blood is not at all consumed by the cells, resulting in high very BG or hyperglycemia. In this case you need direct insulin injections as your pancreas is not able to generate it at all.

Now, low BG or hypoglycemia is caused when you take meds or insulin, and on the same side have stopped consuming sugars and carbohydrates. This was most of the sugar goes away from the blood leaving you low on sugar or hypoglycemic. In this case you need to consume some sugar back !!!"

No one expects you to be the perfect diabetic.. checking your BG before and 2 hours after every meal. Counting every carb. Change your lancet every finger prick. 

All you have to do is make progress.. try to do better than you did yesterday. And if you don't, that's ok. At least you tried. Burnout is real. Take a break but don't let it keep you down. Dust it off, and try again.

Lausannea,2022-05-07,2,"&gt;Why am I like this?

Simplest answer? You lack healthy coping skills. These skills can be learned! You're turning to food to feel less shitty because it gives you a big dopamine boost, which temporarily alleviates the shitty feelings.

Therapy can help you learn healthier coping skills where you don't feel like food is your only source to help you feel better. It can also help you figure out where your depression comes from; could be 'just' diabetes, but diabetes can also be the thing that tipped you over when you were already struggling with something else.

Bottom line is: you are reacting to a brain chemistry irregularity from a (mostly) unknown cause with the only tool you have available to you right now. It's not a moral failing. New tools can be learned, there's nothing inherently broken about you that keeps you from learning!

Please do reach out to a mental health professional, and make sure to research what's available to you support wise in your area if costs are prohibitive. You're worthy of help. Don't blame yourself for doing the only thing you know to do. Forgive yourself by acknowledging that, and then focus on moving forward to address this in a healthier way."

jehkjehk,2022-05-02,9,"I have the same sentiments about this. The insulin made this so much more manageable rather than being in the abyss of not knowing if your pills are going to drastically help you or not, the same way that insulin does.

Although insulin made it much harder for me to lose and keep my weight. So intermittent fasting helped me with that. And also the occasional troubling lows, that are scary."
Accomplished-Job2627,2022-05-02,-5,"So insulin, as a hormone tells the cells whether to store available energy as fat or use fat fir energy. When insulin is high, it is on storage mode, this I s why maintaining weight control is so hard. 

Gently, I will ask this question - if eating no or very little carbs can reduce/eliminate the need for insulin very quickly, why not do that rather than insulin? It's really not that hard."
jehkjehk,2022-05-02,9,"Because contrary to popular belief, our insulin levels are not the same. Heck insulin levels vary day by day. If eating little, or say keto, works for you, then that's awrsome. But that doesn't work for everyone else. We all have our oen therapies to this disease. It is never a one size fits all thing nor a cookie cutter approach to this disease."
Accomplished-Job2627,2022-05-02,-4,"That is NOT what the science says. There are well documented studies such as Verta health that clearly and consistently show this to be the case. Yes, everyone is different has become quite the mantra. The difference is the rate of response IN MOST CASES. the biology really is not that different.

Knightmare84,2022-05-02,1,I do this for the most part but if I eat even a cup of potatoes I'm at 250mg which does substantial damage to my small fiber neuropathy which is one of the reasons I'm on the prednisone which gives me the insulin resistance in the first place....
nrgins,2022-05-02,1,"Insulin will only store carbs as fat if there are extra carbs. It simply makes it easier to store as fat. This is why many people gain weight when they go on insulin: because they're eating too many calories already, and then when they go on insulin, the body stores the extra calories more easily.

So as long as one watches what one eats, insulin won't lead to weight gain. It will always prioritize the immediate energy needs of the body over fat storage."
gsmastering,2022-05-02,3,"I just got off Metformin after developing ulcers too (after 20 years) My recommendation is to get on a long acting insulin like Tresiba, and bolus with short acting insulin if you are going to eat carby meals.

Knightmare84,2022-05-02,1,"Agreed.   I'm only really using the insulin now as I'm eating a lot of potatoes as they're the only thing which soothes my ulcer but also skyrocket my blood sugar.   Otherwise I eat mushrooms, spinach, kale, and chicken breast almost exclusively."
juanimator,2022-05-02,1,"Im not a doctor. You asked if there are downsides so here is one&

A downside of being insulin resistant and taking insulin is that high levels of insulin can lead to heart disease. In fact its a better indicator of heart disease than cholesterol.

The new study,&, shows that too much insulin in the blood (hyperinsulinemia) contributes to heart failure by triggering a molecular chain reaction that damages heart muscle cells. https://medicine.uiowa.edu/content/how-diabetes-harms-heart

T1 diabetics do not make insulin, so this is not an issue for them. Metformin is a fantastic medicine for T2s because metformin doesnt stimulate insulin production, it just helps your body use the insulin your body produces.

It seems the steroids you take are the culprit raising your blood sugar and A1C. Im not sure you can take enough metformin to counter that. Even eating strict low carb may not counter it. Sorry I have no suggestions. Hope all turns out well."

\* Chelated magnesium: 400 mg  
\* GTF Chromium: 600 mcg  
\* Alpha lipoic acid: 600 mg"

That was around 1992 somewhere between christmas and new year, while most of the staff had a holiday, so for a few days (/decades) he became my new best friend. During the holidays he didn't have many patients to follow up so I saw him for several hours per day.

Over here it's pretty unusual that a newly diagnosed T2D is followed up immediately by an endocrinologist. Normally the family doctor sets it up."

When I do find one it takes about 1-3 months to get an appointment. Ive recently moved out of state, so Im looking for a new one, in my current state, and it seems they dont have any in my area.

nallvf,2022-05-05,15,Was she still taking her insulin during this period?
doctornorway,2022-05-06,1,It was pretty sudden onset. She ate a 45 carb dinner and we dosed her for it (been doing shots after dinner while she is sick) and then her Lantus. 4 hours later this all started. So strange!
nallvf,2022-05-06,4,"The reason I ask is because DKA is related to a lack of usable insulin. eDKA is pretty unusual for that reason, usually a lack of insulin means elevated sugars. When diabetics aren't eating because they are sick or whatever sometimes insulin is also reduced, which can lead to a bad feedback loop.

Usually moderate ketones wouldn't put you in DKA but also things can be quite different in children. If you are concerned about this, I strongly suggest picking up a blood-ketone meter. They will give you accurate values without trying to match colors and also give you current readings, as opposed to the highly delayed and hydration-dependent urine sticks.

The one I use is [this one](https://www.freestyle.abbott/ca-en/blood-glucose-meters/freestyle-precision-neo.html), it is a ketone meter and a regular glucometer in one."
Lausannea,2022-05-06,1,"eDKA happens due to a lack of carbs mostly, but it's also common in sick people for other reasons. Being ill wreaks all kinds of havoc on our bodies.

I personally believe eDKA is a lot more common than we think, it's just severely underdiagnosed because there's still the misconception DKA always happens due to high glucose levels (which also isn't true as you pointed out).

I'm not sure if moderate ketones would qualify as eDKA here though."
jlindley1991,2022-05-06,1,Yeah I think these ketones are starvation ketones from not being able to keep anything down. Eventually the body starts burning fat for energy creating ketones as a byproduct of this process. I could be wrong tho as I'm not a doctor.
Sprig3,2022-05-06,1,"Yeah, I mean the BG part is technically, that's the definition of DKA ""A diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) requires the patients plasma glucose concentration to be above 250 mg per dL (although it usually is much higher), the pH level to be less than 7.30, and the bicarbonate level to be 18 mEq per L or less.""  


[https://medicalcriteria.com/web/diabetic-ketoacidosis-hyperosmolar/](https://medicalcriteria.com/web/diabetic-ketoacidosis-hyperosmolar/)

But, it's a mediocre definition at best.  The pH level is the real problem part.  But.... you can't just test your pH at home (accurately enough anyways).  Normal blood pH is 7.35 - 7.45, with 7.3 being DKA... An at home tester has a resolution of 0.1 and accuracy of +/- 0.1... so a 7.4 on the meter could be 7.3 and be DKA, ugh!"
t1dmommy,2022-05-06,4,"how old is she? when my t1d kid was 2-3 years old and got any vomiting sickness we'd end up in ER due to ketones from dehydration. he would need IV fluids. he pretty much outgrew that though, or maybe I got better at keeping him hydrated. small sips of water or liquid help!"
doctornorway,2022-05-06,2,Shes 5 so thankfully a bit of a head start. Our issue is she cant keep stuff down at all. We did learn she needs insulin regardless if she can hold stuff down or not so we are working through it!
MuttonDelmonico,2022-05-06,2,"It sounds like you did the right thing. I'm sure you know all this by now, but just to be clear:

1. eDKA doesn't happen often, you don't need to worry about it in normal circumstances.
2. When it does happen, it's usually due to intense dehydrating illness (vomiting and/or diarrhea). I've also seen reports of intense cardio exercise causing it. Anorexia. 
3. eDKA, like all DKA, is caused by a lack of insulin in the body. 
4. If your kiddo is sick and especially if she cannot take as much insulin as normal, it's time to start monitoring ketones.
5. If you see rising ketones, you can try and fix by giving her sugar AND insulin to match it, thereby increasing the amount of insulin in her system.
6. If she can't keep the sugar down (making extra insulin dangerous), it's hospital time."
Lausannea,2022-05-06,2,"&gt;eDKA, like all DKA, is caused by a lack of insulin in the body.

That's not entirely true. I've been on the verge of eDKA despite taking my usual amount of long-acting insulin, but I was ill and didn't eat for 24 hours or so and ended up with very high ketones (dark purple on urinalysis strips).

eDKA is primarily caused by a sudden and severe deficiency of carbs and dehydration in a body that doesn't have normal insulin regulation and therefore doesn't have properly functioning mechanisms that occur alongside the insulin mechanism, not by a simple lack of insulin."
Sprig3,2022-05-06,1,"I dunno if that's true on the carbs.  Your body can produce glucose out of protein or fat if it thinks it needs to.  (People eating ""Keto"" still create glucose.  It's actually the method through which Metformin works to help type 2: it reduces the rate of glycerol (fat) -&gt; glucose [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4074244/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4074244/) )

And if it were ""due to lack of carbs"", how come starving normals don't have edka?

I think your final paragraph is pretty solid, though.  It's the insulin signaling that is messed up."
Lausannea,2022-05-06,1,"A lack of carbs is the main part of it; I'm explicitly implying a lack of food in general, but it's primarily lack of carbs that triggers the ketosis, and the absence of other food then works in tandem with the excessive ketone production.

Insulin production doesn't happen in a bubble either. When your body produces insulin, it also produces byproducts from the way the endocrine system functions. This includes glucagon production which stimulates glucose release. This is done by the alpha cells. While autoimmune diabetes specifically targets the beta cells, the alpha cells are partially triggered by beta cell activity. Lack of insulin production means a disregulated alpha cell stimulation, which is why we can't rely on our livers to save us from lows in a similar way nondiabetics can.

The endocrine system is very complex and loss of insulin production has affects beyond simply insulin production. Amylin is another example of that, but I won't dive too deep into that.

Glucornomies don't suffer from this. Their body produces insulin and releases glucagon at the same time, which is why their bodies don't fall into eDKA anywhere near as fast. Starvation does trigger heavy ketones and ketoacidosis is still possible in non-diabetics for other reasons. eDKA doesn't happen to them because eDKA specifically occurs in diabetics, hence euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis, and not euglycemic ketoacidosis."
Sprig3,2022-05-06,1,"So, your logic is that the lack of carbs causes it, but it doesn't happen for normals because they produce insulin?

Yeah, there are super rare cases of eka happening to normals, but super rare and starvation is common. (carbohydrates missing, but hormones present - very rare ka)

So,

Normals + no carbs + with hormones = Not ka (or at least not commonly)

T1 + carbs + no insulin = ka (almost all the time)

T1 + no carbs + no insulin = ka (almost all the time)

I think if you re-examine the logic, you will see that the dietary carbs don't appear to be the important factor (esp since the body can produce glucose with the right signals).  The hormones (which you seem to have a good grasp of!) are the important factor."
Lausannea,2022-05-07,1,"You've... literally missed a significant portion of my post that explains what natural insulin production *does* beyond producing *just* insulin. This has nothing to do with logic and all with a failure to understand that insulin production doesn't exist in a bubble that only affects insulin.

I refuse to further engage in this discussion until this information is acknowledged."
Sprig3,2022-05-07,1,"&gt;The hormones (which you seem to have a good grasp of!) are the important factor.  


Note that I said hormones.  I realize the feast/fast metabolic cycle is complicated and each hormone involved affects the production of the other hormones involved.  (Insulin inhibits glucagon, insulin stimulates leptin, beta cells produce both insulin and amylin (and leptin inhibits natural insulin production, but obviously, that doesn't mean anything for type 1's).)

What I'm saying is that it's not the (lack of) dietary carbs which are the cause of ka.  It's the hormones.

The simplest evidence of this is that starvation is quite common, but ka is not in people without type 1 diabetes."
vastmagick,2022-05-06,2,"Even amongst diabetics it will differ as to what people say.  I mean, we really just say what we have experienced and were told.

I tend to keep my understanding of DKA very basic to avoid assumptions.  If any of this seems super obvious, I'm sorry I want to set a level understanding before explaining(also so if someone disagrees they can point to either a basic fact or a claim I built from a basic fact).

* DKA is the build of up ketones in the body, to the point that the blood becomes too acidic.  Acids become more acidic when there is less water to dilute them and less acidic when there is more water.  Ketones are one of the products of burning fat for energy.  There are various ways we start burning fat for energy to include: We haven't used glucose in a while or our body needs supplemental energy (like when we are sick).  ([here is my favorite detailed breakdown of ketones](https://dtc.ucsf.edu/types-of-diabetes/type2/understanding-type-2-diabetes/how-the-body-processes-sugar/ketones/))
* Every person, even nondiabetics, burn fat when they are sick to help the immune system.  But as diabetics our system is a little out of wack and our body can start burning fat too fast, turning our blood too acidic to be good for our internal organs and taxing our kidneys as they try to filter out the ketones.  To combat this we can drink more water to dilute our acidic blood and to help our kidneys filter out and flush out the ketones.  And that is where DKA can get dangerous because it can make us nauseous and prevent us from staying hydrated.

When people say DKA is caused by not enough insulin they are not wrong, not having enough insulin is a cause.  But it isn't the only cause, and DKA can occur if you have plenty of insulin and your blood sugar is normal.  Depending on the cause, eating carbs and taking additional insulin to utilize those carbs can help.

Whenever I am sick, and I didn't do this when I was younger and reckless, I try to drink as much water/sugar free Gatorade as possible.  I check my blood sugar more often to help reduce the number of causes of DKA, and I try to add more carbs into my diet to help fuel my immune system."
thefutureofamerica,2022-05-06,2,"Sorry to ask, but since youre new to this, its important to clarify. Does she have ketones according to a urine strip or has she been diagnosed with DKA? Theres a big difference. Sorry youre going through this!"
jeffbell,2022-05-05,6,"I'm going to do short answers since you are in the ER.

You don't ""catch"" euglycemic DKA.  It's the blood chemistry being off.

No doubt they will check the labs and give the necessary IV fluids to get things back into shape.  Only once that is OK is it worth considering the causes."

DoEsNtReAlLyMaTtErD,2022-05-06,1,"Ketones will start to build up when you cant keep any food or drink down. To get rid of ketones, you need to take in insulin and glucose at the same time. When Im not feeling great I try to take a little sips of sugary drinks (like flat coke, lemonade or just some sugar dissolves in a glass of water works well when youve been vomiting as its not as irritating on the oesophagus) every so often and an appropriate bolus of insulin (or increase nasal rate if on pump). Be weary that when youre Ill your insulin requirements are likely to go up because youre not well. Also, if youre nauseous and vomiting, dont give yourself the full bolus amount. Split it in two and give the second half after youve consumed the food/drink and know that youre not going to grown it up (all advice from my diabetes nurse). 

Also, it might sounds strange but a lot of people can feel that theyre either high or have ketones or are going that way. Id sure your daughter will learn to recognise it in how shes feeling aster a bit of time.  I dont know what the rules are where you live, but in UK were not allowed to be released from hospital until a member of the endocrinology team have seen us and weve spoken to the diabetes nurse about what happened, what could have caused it, how to prevent it in the future etc. Generally we see a member of the endo team every three months for checkups and can get in touch with the diabetes nurse whenever we need to."
jonathanlink,2022-05-09,13,"I just want to point out that your initial post is something of confirmation bias. You eat vegetarian so you self-selected studies that support your beliefs. Diets that cut carbs, like keto, can be sustainable. Vegetarian diets can lower blood sugar, but you do need to switch away from starchy vegetables from your primary fuel/volume source."
bathLover123,2022-05-09,3,I would argue it is much harder to go low carb on vegetarian and especially vegan diets. I don't think it's impossible but definitely harder for the average person.
jonathanlink,2022-05-09,2,"I cant really disagree with this since most vegetarians and vegans focus on high energy sources of carbs (starches) for the bulk of their diet. Starch is nothing more than glucose in a form that is slightly less glycemic than glucose, but only slightly because breakdown of starch begins in the mouth. 

That being said, the OP wasnt saying go low carb, vegetarian or vegan. Just being regular vegetarian or vegan. 

I remember a poster here about a year ago, who claimed to eat 400g of carbs per day. Was whole food plant based, too. Well, it turned out after teasing the details, of that 400g of carbs, 200g (or more) of that was fiber.  But, they were type 1, and appeared to be metabolically healthy. The OP, by dint of having type 2 and also being obese, by their own admission, is metabolically unhealthy. 

Also the OP suggests that the keto diet is unsustainable. No metric is provided to gauge sustainability, but the Virta health study with 70%+ adherence after 3 years demonstrates the sustainability of keto, especially within the context of managing type 2 diabetes. 

I, myself, am keto for just over a year and intend to be keto for life. But I had good success on the Zone for a year and brought my a1c from 10.4 to 6.1 over the course of a year while also coming off glimepiride from a 4mg (max dose), cutting it in half about every 3-4 months. 

Ive just had better success with keto. Managing satiety, controlling blood sugars better and coming off even more meds with a lower a1c. My goal is not no meds, but as few meds as possible while maintaining good health."

Plant based/vegetarian can work for some type 2s, for example, but many cannot. Keto can work for some type 2s, but many cannot. Fasting can work for some type 2s, but many cannot. That's why we recommend that people try things out, check their progress with glucose testing and regular checkups with a doctor, and find the diet that works for them and gives them the desired results that works with their body.

Lots of fiber helps, so does 'cushioning' the carbs with some fat.  

Pizza messes me up, but pizza on a whole-wheat balance tortilla isn't bad, or pizza-eggs.  Instead of burritos (with that giant white-flour tortilla), I get bowls with **minimal** or no rice."
savvyliterate,2022-05-09,1,"When I was diagnosed, my insurance paid for sessions with a nutritionist and a diabetes educator. It was super helpful. Both them and my doctor were very much, ""Stay the hell away from keto,"" because it would cause more issues than solve them - especially with the medication I'm on. I'm on a moderate carb diet. I eat between 30-45g carbs per meal and 15-20g per snack. Overall, I try to keep to between 150-200g of carbs per day.

Like you, I eat a lot of Asian/Indian/Middle Eastern food, though I am not a vegetarian. What you want to focus on isn't the amount of carbs but the type of carbs. Brown rice, for example, breaks down far more slowly than white rice, so it causes less of a spike. Vegetable-based pastas like those made of edamame are high in protein and great for your blood sugar. I did also cut back on the amount of carbs. Like, instead of having 1 cup of white rice with my meal, I have 1/2 cup of brown rice. I also make noodle swaps. I made this fantastic all-vegetable pad see ew over the weekend that used konjac sheets instead of the wider Thai noodles, and the sauce was sweetned with monk fruit. Though I did also add a little bit of normal sugar as well since I'm not on keto.

The order in which you eat is important too: first your veggies, then your protein, then your carbs if possible. There are scientific papers to back that up, and I have definitely seen a difference if I break down a meal like that. Of course, it's not always possible like with salads.

What I do find keto sites are helpful for are recipes, then I tweak to suit my diet. This website has been super helpful to me, and I feel like I'm able to cook the Japanese food I love again: [Low Carbing Asian](https://www.lowcarbingasian.com/). I just make swaps, like brown rice instead of cauliflower rice.

Oh, and in case you want it, here's the [pad see ew recipe](https://chloeting.com/recipes/low-carb-pad-see-ew) I made. I doubled the sauce because I used a LOT of veggies instead of chicken in the dish I made."
Warpig777,2022-05-09,1,"""You cannot have T2 diabetes without carbs."", Dr. Cywes the #CarbAddictionDoc

It's actually very easy to live a low carb lifestyle. Create your meals by choosing a protein and a vegetable, and you're done! You're now eating like a human should be. It doesn't get any easier than that.

It's possible that your GMI (based on your average) and your lab result is not exactly the same. [Here](https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc8255314/bin/supp_figs1-tables1.docx) you can find an article about the correlation between the two. A difference of 1% is considered pretty common."
Sprig3,2022-05-10,2,"Somehow I can't scroll down on that page. (Chrome browser)

But, yeah, agreed, GMI is a linear regression line made from cgm data from (if I have read the paper right) 528 people and compared it with their A1C.

A 150 average glucose on the cgm had anywhere from a 5.8 to 7.9 A1C in the participants studied.  But, GMI for 150 comes out as 6.9.  Overall, though the GMI looks pretty strong in that range (lots of dots in the middle of the scatter plot).  But, there are a good number of outliers.

GMI starts to break down completely when you go below around the 110/120 average.  We know from other studies that normals average around 100 mg/dL and  have A1C around 5.1, but the GMI formula would predict an A1C of 5.7.

A GMI of 5.1 would correspond to an average glucose of 75.  (what?!?! hehe)

A GMI of 4.0 (often quoted as the lowest end of normal acceptable A1C) would correspond  to an average glucose of 29.  (Obviously, someone with a low-4 A1C is not having an average of 29.)"

I would rather retest before the appt to either verify the first results and THEN try to troubleshoot what Im doing wrong or eliminate the first result as an error and not waste time barking up the wrong info tree. Looking at the study plot makes me wonder whether the outlier points had other variables involved (they indicated that advanced kidney disease had a greater impact on wonky A1C results), and they also indicated the average wear time of the cgm as being a mean of 24 days. That is troubling to me if they are making conclusions for a 90-day A1C test based on a 24-day monitoring time period. The results would more valid if they were comparing apples-to-apples, time period-wise. Its still interesting info."
Sprig3,2022-05-11,2,"&gt;That is troubling to me if they are making conclusions for a 90-day A1C test based on a 24-day monitoring time period.

Yeah, completely agree.  It seems like a line is not the right fit either (maybe a curve of some sort would fit better).

I think a much better study could be done, and I don't think it would be crazy expensive - just get a huge number (perhaps thousands or tens of thousands would be possible?) of people to share their A1C and dexcom data that already exists.  I know I'd be willing to do it for free (or maybe some small reward to give a push,)  

The data is already there, people are already getting their A1C's done.  Yeah, it would have some weird factors in it (like how are we sure the dexcom data is accurate, how do we know we've recruited a representative pop, etc).  But, would have a big leg up on the current GMI paper.

At the end of the day, though, imo, TIR is king (with average glucose then second and standard deviation third)."

Leeanth,2022-05-10,2,"Don't worry about it. Just concentrate on your control in the lead-up to the next test.

All kinds of factors come into an a1c.

My last one was 7, but only because I had weeks of constant lows after my third Covid vax in January.

I've recently been ill and spent a few days in hospital, during which time (especially the time in hospital) I was constantly extremely high because I was getting insufficient insulin. My current a1c estimate (according to my CGM) is above 8.

I know I am doing the best I can do at the moment and my numbers have been really great this week (between 84 and 94 per cent in range).

My next a1c, due in a few weeks, is definitely going to be well above 7. However, I know I'm heading in the right direction.

Shit happens, despite our best efforts.

A 7.9 is still better than an 8+. Don't let anyone bully you into thinking you MUST reach a goal within a particular period. There are always going to be fluctuations up and down."

Lausannea,2022-05-10,-1,"A1Cs aren't an exact science. They're an indicator that rely on a general context encompassing your entire management history, not a final test grade for how well you did.

Many things can influence your result, including simply having longer than average hemoglobin turnover rates (meaning your red blood cells live longer than the average 2-3 months). It's useful to diagnose diabetes, and it's useful to people who don't have reliable accurate CGM technology, but I'm of the personal opinion that sensors you've verified are accurate give a MUCH better indication of your management and efforts.

Reasons for this include that time spent in range is more important than your A1C; you can have a lot of highs and a lot of lows and still have a 'good' A1C, but your time in range (TIR) is very low. But you can have a high TIR and a 'bad' A1C that is higher than anticipated.

Furthermore, strong fluctuations in glucose levels (aka going high and then low in a short period of time at frequent intervals) indicates that your management may need to be reviewed, which is something A1C doesn't offer.

Diabetes management is a lot more  complex than just 'strive for a low A1C'. I encourage you to look at your past 3 months as a whole, taking your CGM data into account, reviewing your diet and exercise regime, and being fair to yourself on how well you did with the resources available to you. These things will give a much healthier indication of how you're doing than a number that can be flawed for reasons outside of our control!"

I have the Libre 14 day, so alarms aren't an issue for me. Nor do I really care about using alarms anyway.

In any case, I posted this because I wanted to get the information before I inserted my next sensor in a week. But after reading responses I realized it wouldn't do any harm to try it.

Like blood pressure, blood sugar can have triggers:  
  
- stress  
- sickness  
- caffeine"

rozlinski,2022-05-22,1,"Give it some time.  I had to titrate up over a period of weeks to 2000 units, still changed my diet, include exercise, and then it was a year before I was getting normal numbers.  Dont check you sugar until at least **two hours** after eating, though. 

Just curious.  Why were you checking blood sugar before diagnosis?"
GCF_In_Luv,2022-05-22,1,I know some of the symptoms for it and I've been super dehydrated no matter how much water I drank. I knew that was a symptom so I checked my sugar.
ando1135,2022-05-22,1,"Sorry for your diagnosis, I was diagnosed a couple days ago as type 2. I was prescribed Jardiance 25mg but thing is I have been doing low carb for months already and with this drug I cant do low carb because the risk is it can cause diabetic ketoacidosis, which is a serious condition. Ugh, I havent been sure how to eat, but this morning I had a little headache with nausea and vomiting ( dry heaving) and those are symptoms of DKA=. So I ate some carbs today, hope tomorrow I dont feel like that."
in_the_sheyd,2022-05-22,1,"You might want to get some urine ketone test strips from the pharmacy and test your pee once a day until things get better. If those strips start testing positive for ketones you want to go to back to urgent or the emergency room but otherwise you should be fine waiting.

Just schedule an appointment with your primary provider sooner rather than later.

Oh& and be careful with physical exercise when your blood glucose is so high. Exercise is great for controlling blood glucose but physical exertion may be unsafe when youre already high enough to be symptomatic."
ClayWheelGirl,2022-05-22,1,"when i first went on metformin it took my body about 4 or 5 days to adjust. it made me nauseous initially.

i wasnt assigned a glucometer for another 4 months - took me a whole lot of fighting to get one.

but right away i changed my lifestyle. i didnt really have to change my diet much. had to reduce my portion size n stop snacking. i was very sedentary. instead of a glucometer i invested in a smart watch and keep to my steps. my usual day is 15000 to 20,000 steps. huge impact.

as i lost weight my numbers improved.

and i am one of those lucky ones unaffected by metformin. take it on empty stomach. no problems."

[This video](https://youtu.be/m_AGfZYAQsU?t=106) explains metformin.  
  
Key points:  
  
- Metformin is 3 drugs in 1 pill
- There are multiple processes. The video explains them very well  
- You eat metformin around 45 minutes before eating. You aim for affecting your breakfast and dinner.  
- Some people require a long release metformin"

ElaborateCantaloupe,2022-05-22,2,This isnt true. Ive had a few endocrinologists prescribe metformin. Its generally the first medicine they go to for treatment. But dont trust me.

Healing is harder for us than non-diabetics, its much easier to get an infection, so keep it as clean as humanely possible. Do not touch it even once. Follow instructions of artist for the aftercare to a T and youll be good. Only thing of concern is infection, and first sign of that, go get antibiotics right away, dont wait and see if it gets better. If you need some advice hit me up."
Forward-Bumblebee-18,2022-05-24,4,thanks man Ive definitely been wondering about tattoos since i  became diabetic  Ive always planned to have a good amount but recently Ive been scared of getting one
feministmanlover,2022-05-24,3,"Is your diabetes well managed?  Is your A1c like 7 or less?  If so, you're okay. Might take a little longer to heal but you'll be fine as long as you follow the after care instructions and continue to manage your bg.  I'm type 1 and have 7 tattoos plus a full sleeve.  My A1c is 5.8.

samkrugermusic,2022-05-24,2,"My sole tattoo is simply the outline of a circle, only took about 10 minutes so my comment might not be useful for you... But zero problems, healed fast and smoothly. I keep my B/G in pretty good control."
NigerianCEO,2022-05-24,2,I got my tattoo a few months ago and the healing process was actually quicker than my non diabetic roommate. Just make sure to keep it properly cleaned and keep your BG in check. I highly recommend aquaphor for the first few days of the healing process.
MysticMarbles,2022-05-24,1,Never had any issues with mine. Healed like they should have in the time they should have.

I just did my normal aftercare routine and ate well and took insulin like usual. I dont know what my blood sugars were during the appointments cant remember. It wasnt until my 6th one, It got infected and then I realized my sugars were not in the normal range I would have liked them to be in during it and the wrap that was supposed to keep it clean might have failed. So it got infected but it goes to say if you are diabetic its not impossible to get a tattoo. But matters is the aftercare and during the appt that you keep blood monitored. Otherwise you know your body in the end. I plan on still finishing this tattoo even though it got infected. I think us diabetics getting tattoos must be risky ==="
MRflibbertygibbets,2022-05-24,1,"Mine healed on my forearm really well, but I was paranoid and attentive as heck with following the artists directions"
Gibora89,2022-05-24,1,"I have 3 tattoos and will be getting a 4th soon. One thing I highly recommend is to make sure your sugars are in a good range the day of getting the tattoo.  Bring with you to the appt whatever you use to check your sugar, insulin if you use it, and a snack. I've found that sometimes, while my blood sugar will spike during the process, as soon as it's all done, it drops hard. So, bringing a snack is a good idea. 

Good luck! I love tattoos, its a process and the results tend to be great! Just do whatever the artist says, they're gonna give you some good advice for aftercare and such. I would also recommend letting the artist know that you're a diabetic, they are very appreciative of knowing things like that just in case something goes wrong."

friendless2,2022-05-17,15,"It is also possible to be both.  T1 with resistance.  

The C-Peptide result could be the most telling if T1 or not."
sccullen33,2022-05-17,4,"I guess we will find out. unfortunately I just had an appointment with my Endocrinologist and have to wait to discuss these results until my next appointment.  from what the C-peptide test results are showing ( which says normal range is 1.0 to 4.4 ) , mine was a 1.7 , my pancreas is still producing some of it's own insulin."
friendless2,2022-05-18,8,That is a long honeymoon
bionic_human,2022-05-18,6,"Or, /u/sccullen33 could have a variant of T3 where there was a reduction in islet/b-cell mass due to some external factor (chemical exposure, pancreatic inflammation, viral infection, whatever) that is enough to cause blood sugars to be elevated enough to be diagnostic for diabetes, but not so much as to zero out c-peptide. 

Or there could be some weird genetic thing in play where a mutation cropped up in the gene that codes for insulin, so it could still be being made and released, but not be usable. Or (not knowing family history), it could be a MODY variant.

Once you get out of the clear-cut T1/T2 space, there's lots of weird, obscure ways that you can still wind up with diabetes without autoimmunity or resistance necessarily being directly in play."
bionic_human,2022-05-17,6,What specific tests? What were the results? Is this doctor a diabetes specialist?
4thshift,2022-05-18,5,"Not impossible to goof up. 

How much insulin have you been taking?

If you have a family history of everyone on one side getting diabetes at a young age, then maybe it is genetic MODY.

Halle Berry for one famous example had DKA and was on insulin for a long time and said she was Type 1, but then used keto and exercise to get off of her insulin and now says she is Type 2. Which probably means she has KPD, a variation of Type 2 where people can need insulin initially but not so much later on."
sccullen33,2022-05-18,3,This is definitely going to be an interesting discussion with my Dr. I guess I'm worried about just switching medications and getting complications or getting DKA. Maybe this is a good thing and I've been treating this wrong for years? ..idk
4thshift,2022-05-18,3,Let us know what you find out some day.
crimsonscyes,2022-05-17,4,I'd ask for a copy of the test results if I were you.
sccullen33,2022-05-17,3,I've actually seen the test results with my own eyes because my local healthcare network has a online access to your health records. Havent spoken to my Endocrinologist in person yet but he sent a digital letter that states all the bloodwork indicates I am Type 2 not Type 1 and we will be discussing medication changes and such at the next appointment
sccullen33,2022-05-17,5,"I'm just as confused as you are honestly, I was diagnosed at age 22 or 23 and I was very very sick and was hospitalized. started on insulin ( slow and fast acting ) immediately.  I'm now 45 and now not a type 1?..confused to say the least. This is coming from my regular Endocrinologist that I've had for approximately a year now after my old Endo retired . he suggested the blood tests because apparently I've never had these specific ones done and he wanted to be sure we were doing the right meds. Surprise surprise I guess? idk.."
GoldPenalty7702,2022-05-18,3,Congrats! Some pancreas is better than no pancreas:)
Mereology,2022-05-18,4,"There was some study (Joslin Center I think) that showed a lot of very long term T1Ds were still producing some insulin (suggesting they're the weirdos or misdiagnosed cases that were living the longest, IIRC).  As others have mentioned, there's a lot of weird ambiguous diagnoses once you get out of the very clear T1 and T2 categories.

I would be slightly cautious with a new doc.  I've had the occasional doctor question my diagnosis despite being a clear T1 with all the labs to show it, because I'm not slim and was not diagnosed as a child, and a lot of the medical world seems baffled by anything like LADA or MODY.  What medication changes are they thinking?  If you've had success with insulin, I'd be wary of any major push to get away from it, and even very classic T1s can benefit from some T2 meds.  Be warned - some insurance companies will be inclined to deny certain meds and equipment to T2s that they'll cover for T1s, so check that out before your doctor does anything drastic."
sccullen33,2022-05-17,3,"a C- peptide test, an antibody test etc. Yes the Dr is an endocrinologist. I have had him as my Dr for about a year or so after my Endo that I had for like 15 years retired"
bionic_human,2022-05-17,7,"Autoantibodies are going to be negative in most people with longstanding T1D. There are also several different types, although many physicians will only commonly test for one.

C-peptide is going to be a lot more relevant. What was that level?"
sccullen33,2022-05-18,3,Autoantibodies were negative. C-peptide was a 1.7
bionic_human,2022-05-18,3,"Interesting. That **would** be more indicative of T2, although it's not outside the ""normal"" range either. Were you fasting for the blood draw?"
sccullen33,2022-05-18,2,Yes it was a fasting blood draw
hiding-identity23,2022-05-18,2,Did the doctor run all the antibody tests? And were those tests run at your initial diagnosis?
sccullen33,2022-05-18,2,Yes the Dr ran all the antibody tests and apparently I've never had them done before. was diagnosed over 20 years ago though so not sure
Sensorium139,2022-05-20,1,"I'd look into a new Dr. I'm already negative for autoantibodies with 8 years of type 1 (almost 9) and I don't know my current cpeptide but it was like 0.9 or 0.7 at dx, and metformin didn't work.  If you're doing good on your treatment, don't let someone change it."

BarefootedDave,2022-04-27,2,"I havent had a full bore sugary drink in a couple of years now. Ive fallen in love with a majority of diet drinks. Ordered a Diet Mtn Dew with some food the other week. Got served regular. Nearly puked when I took my first sip. Jesus, I used to drink multiple bottles of that crap daily."
buddahsumo,2022-04-27,3,I loved Coke but now Pepsi Zero sugar is my favorite sugar free beverage.
Techfumaster,2022-04-27,3,"I was/am a cola fiend and have been since childhood.  Pre diag I drank five or six 24oz bottles of regular ""pop"" (I'm in the upper Midwest so it's all pop to me) a day.  I like a variety so I hit all the big names.  Diabetes runs in the family, so I was at least moderately aware of what I was doing to my body with all that sugar, but the thought of diet pop was disgusting and I would literally spit it out if I was accidentally served a diet at a restaurant.  When my pancreas eventually succumbed to the abuse and I was diagnosed t2 in 2010 (with an a1c of nearly 11 ... gee I wonder what could have possibly driven it that high), it was either give up pop or go blind.  I'm ashamed to say the decision wasn't as much of a no brainer as it should have been.

Eventually I came to terms with my reality and quit my sugary drink habit.  And like most, I suffered through the transition to diet, hating what I was drinking but not being able to live without my fizzy bubbles and caffeine.  It took several months, but with all of the other changes to my diet, my taste buds did eventually die ... errr, I mean adjust ... and the diet pop stopped tasting horrid and drinking it became enjoyable again.

As others have said, some of the newer ""zero"" formulas are much closer to the taste of a normal soda and are worth trying.  Though let's be honest, no sane person is going to 'not know the difference'.

However, a word of caution because I haven't seen it mentioned here yet.  The artificial sweeteners in pretty much all of the sugar free drinks have been linked to some pretty nasty health consequences.  If you can find alternatives that you can live with, you should.  I still drink my five or six bottles of various diet/zero pop a day, and at my volume it does add up and I can say that it is a likely culprit for some of my health complications.  Be mindful of that as you start thinking about your transition away from the nectar of the gods ... err, I mean sugary soda.

Oh, and while it's not cola, anyone who loves fizz and needs the caffeine fix that hasn't tried Blackberry ICE with caffeine is missing out.  I've tried all of the fizzy fruity drinks you can think of, and that stuff is by far the best.  I'm convinced it's made with a proprietary blend of unicorn dust, magic bean extract, and water from the fountain of youth.  The Amazon delivery drivers in my area hate me for a myriad of reasons, but they have a particularly nasty look on their faces when they have to schlep the 4 cases I have on subscription up my driveway to the porch every couple of weeks.  I almost feel bad for them.  Almost.

Good luck on your journey!"
samiralove,2022-04-27,1,"Thanks man. Mind you, one coke can a day was my habit....I grew up in the North East where it was known as Soda but now live in the Midwest where Pop reigns. I drink plenty of seltzer. When I grew up we had 2L bottles of coke and Sunkist around the house. 

When I was on keto my taste buds acclimated to the diet stuff, it was a weird phenomenon. I normally hate the taste. I am not doing keto now but trying my best to limit carbs and/or eat complex carbs. 

I even told my doc who wanted me to cut back on soda that I could replace it with 4 tsps of sugar w tea, another fav drink of mine. She said ok bc 4tsp is better than 9 in soda but I haven't had it since.

Abby_Benton,2022-04-27,2,"I am with you, I miss cola. I cant do diet or coke zero, the taste just doesnt work. My goal is to get to a point where once a year, on the day of my choosing, I can have a single 8 ounce coke and not have it be a disaster. I keep thinking about that working to get my numbers down."
samiralove,2022-04-27,2,"Once a year? Jeez.  When you say, have it not be a disaster, do you mean like numbers wise? Does this mean like 9 tbsp of sugar can like eff up all the progress of healthy eating....like which is worse? Cola or pie?"
Abby_Benton,2022-04-27,2,"It really depends on your system, what kind of diabetes you have, how have you been treating it, and a host of other factors. Like everything else about this, diabetes is different for us all.

I get annoying, low grade nerve pain in my neck and my chest right now if my sugar spikes. The pain lasts for a couple of hours. Its not agonizing and I can function, but its painful and nasty. Doctor thinks if I manage my diabetes well for a long time, that may stop when I have the occasional treat."
nrgins,2022-04-27,2,"If I drank a sugary drink, my blood glucose would skyrocket and I'd be down for the count for a couple of hours. I'd get very tired; would have to lay down; would fall asleep; wake up a few hours later and still feel awful. Probably take several hours to get my blood sugar back to normal. 

But  I might over compensate and go low. And then need to eat glucose to bring it back up. But since my blood sugar would be low, and I'd be craving sugar, and since the sugar would take a little bit to get into my system, I'd probably over compensate again and go high.

Then I'd need to bring it down again. But my blood sugar will still be rising. So how much to bring it down won't be clear. So it'll be a game of constantly checking my blood sugar and hoping I don't go low again.

Then, finally, maybe 6 hours after I had the drink, things might be steady and normal again."
nrgins,2022-04-27,2,"I find with most things, the brain adapts.

When I first started drinking diet soda, couldn't stand the taste. 3 months later, it tasted sweet to me. Brain adapted.

I switched to low-fat or no-fat everything. Now whenever I eat something that's not low fat it tastes gross to me -- way too fatty.

Same with salt. Same with anything.

Your brain will adapt eventually.

P.S. While OK for diabetics, diet cola is still basically liquid poison. I used to drink one 2 liter a day. Now I drink almost no cola. How? I switched to fresh brewed iced tea. Much, much healthier and still satisfying. Every once in a while I'll have a diet coke (like maybe a few times a year) but basically I don't desire it anymore. I have a large iced tea every day, along with an iced espresso. And lots of water or sparkling water."

Partly so that I don't feel like I'm having to quit entirely, I keep a bottle in the fridge &amp; treat myself to a sip when my BS crashes."

bionic_human,2022-05-16,16,"Guess. Most officially-labelled carb counts aren't exact anyway. 

If you have to err, err on the side of undershooting and correct after the fact."
nrgins,2022-05-16,9,I do the opposite. I tend to err on the side of overshooting because I find it's easier to raise my blood sugar up if I went too low than it is to lower my blood sugar if I didn't give myself enough insulin.
TheFlyingVegetarian,2022-05-16,2,"I do the same with my son. Its easier to be okay with guessing when you have a CGM though, so were very fortunate in that sense. But I also guess, and try to over guess a little. I usually base it on something I know, like a cupcake Ive seen the carb count on and compare amount of frosting and level of sweetness, etc. It generally works out pretty well."
nrgins,2022-05-16,1,"Yeah, you have to guess a lot based on things you know or things that are similar. It's never an exact science.

And, yeah, having the CGM makes it MUCH easier!!!

I also track my BGs in a spreadsheet that I created in Google Sheets that calculates how much insulin is left in my system (based, crudely, on a 4 hour lifespan of Novalog or Humalog, and dividing the original insulin dose by 4 times and then multiplying by hours left). Works very well.

It also calculates how much of an adjustment dose I need based on my current BG level.

So I can see if the amount it says I still need is close to the amount it says I roughly have left. So that's been super helpful as well.

I find, though, that until the insulin peaks, at 2 to 2 1/2 hours, you can't really get a good read on the situation. Also if your food is still digesting."
diabetes_says_no,2022-05-16,9,"I'd recommend guessing, give yourself a little less insulin than you think you'll need, then check your blood sugar in a bit. It's better to guess and go a lil high and correct it with more insulin than to go low."

mr_bombabstic,2022-05-16,4,Guess and pray
nrgins,2022-05-16,3,Best answer! =
cheech-wizard,2022-05-16,2,Carb Manager. Free app with huge carb content database.  Lists homemade cupcakes at 15-24 grams of carbs/ cupcake.  Id call it 20 till I knew better.
igotzthesugah,2022-05-16,2,I have an app and I also google.  Then I consider who made what Im about to eat vs who made whatever my search found.  I kinda average out the search results.  Its a slightly educated guess.
pissweakpancreas,2022-05-16,2,"For stuff you make yourself you can input the exact recipe and number of servings into the my fitness pal app and it will give you a carb count. Ive found it to be very helpful and pretty accurate as long as I measure out serving sizes well. 
Stuff other people make is a bit trickier, but as others have pointed out estimates are better than nothing."
Sprig3,2022-05-16,2,"You can count the carbs in homemade stuff.  (total the carbs of the ingredients in the recipe, divide by weight or portions)

Can also use rules of thumb like most breads are around 40% carb, most cake-type foods around 50%, and then can weigh your portion.  

But, all that said, ""best guess"" is a good answer.    

How precisely are you measuring the amount of physical activity you are doing before and after the food (2-3 hours both sides) and factoring that into your calculation?  Do you measure your # of heartbeats or # of steps taken and make a prediction for the future #'s of this too?

I ask rhetorically, because physical activity differences can make a 100% difference in insulin needs :D, and people are making a best guess on that and often do well.  

A similar issue exists for fats, too.  Dietary fats increase insulin resistance for (potentially) many hours.  So, in theory, you'd want to count them as well and then apply some multiplier to insulin needs (bolus + basal) for some # of hours after consuming.  

 But, that is a lot, especially since hormonal changes in your body can make a big difference as well!  So, in the end, I think the only practical long-term advice is to estimate."
crimsonscyes,2022-05-16,1,Usually I just Google if it's okay for people with diabetes but there are apps you can download that will tell you if you want to find out more exact numbers.
Girlygabenpepe,2022-05-16,1,You start to learn to estimate stuff. Now I honestly never look at the numbers but it took me years of training to get there.
XXxsicknessxxx,2022-05-16,2,"I work at a restaurant and when I order a omelet or something I just have to guess. But common sense helps here. Look up stuff you eat that lists calories then just guess.
Like I assume the omlet had at least 500 calories because it's so delicious. I dunno but I know it's not 1000 because breakfast normally doesn't top 1000 calories.
Like I would just guess the cupcake has 300 calories. I guess high because it's better to eat less then more and Google can normally give you a basic answer. Just Google how many calories in a cup cake. One last thing a app like any plate can help. Check it out. It helps you tell how much you eat in a day. I figured I eat the daily requirements in calories for myself 1800 - 2000 a day. Plushie had DS so I don't absorb everything soi don't worry a lot anymore. I do think of it. Anything I eat I want to know the calorie. You can guess the ingredients also to guess the calories.

Or just cut everything bad out until your goal and then when your goal just eat like normal if you gain weight just lower your calories or how much your eating maybe you don't know the calorie if you don't just eat half the cup cake. Or again i would just avoid it unless it was a really good looking cupcake. Because everything you eat gets absorbed. 

I'm not a genius here but I am goal 180 6""3 Ds I just hit goal because I couldn't lose the last ten pounds no matter what I did. But it took time and a lot of writing things down. Good luck"

nrgins,2022-05-01,7,"I've been using insulin pens for years, and have never seen one give more than you dial it for. I don't see how that would even be possible.

When you dial it, you're telling it how many clicks to do. Then, when you plunge it, it goes past those clicks to the end, where it stops. I don't see how it could go past the end."
LordRiverknoll,2022-05-01,6,"Pens can malfunction, but it is rare; and usually the pen is totally inoperable.

I had some more advice here before, but I had mistaken tresiba as a short acting insulin. I haven't used a long-acting insulin in over a decade, so I don't know how to give advice in your situation

Good luck!"
anderson1496,2022-05-01,1,So its rare for a pen to be inoperable as in not give insulin? Or give more insulin than dialed for?
LordRiverknoll,2022-05-01,2,"Sorry, should have been more clear there: inoperable as in not give insulin; it would jam. It's also possible, though significantly rarer for the pen to break inside the dialer (give more insulin), but you would immediately notice this as the dialer doesn't 'click' anymore going outwards

Both happened to me when I was using pens some years ago."
anderson1496,2022-05-01,0,"Okay so it had clicking. My issue is, and I may not have explained it well enough, is did the pen give more insulin than I dialed it for? It seems like it clicked more than usual and that the plunger moved more than it usually does for that specific dose."
LordRiverknoll,2022-05-01,2,"Other than human error I haven't had that issue... You're not going to sleep soon are you? 

Back when I used Lantus for my long term insulin, I double dosed once and noticed it about two hours later."
anderson1496,2022-05-01,1,"Im a third shifter so Ill be at work for the next 7hrs. And since its tresiba Ive heard that it is steadier than Lantus. But still, more than required is never a good thing."
Engine_engineer,2022-05-01,3,"Hi OP. Don't worry. I doubled my Trebisa dose twice. It was cheat day with lots of food and goodies between meals. Only that. 

And there is a very, very small possibility (in the vicinity of impossibly) of it to have a mechanical failure and deliver more insulin. You would have noticed by the clicks or the angle you need to twist the pen cap to adjust the amount. Jamming is the most common failure mode, although it never happened to me. 

And again, given the long term action of Trebisa, +/- 25% are hardly noticed by your body. Make a test, inject 25% less one day or two and see the result."
anderson1496,2022-05-01,1,"Thanks for the reply! Im sure that was a very fulfilling day of eating. 

Im just paranoid about my long acting. Not sure why since the rapid acting can have negative effects a lot faster."

AlexeyKruglov,2022-05-01,2,"If you don't change needles, it can clot / partially clot. And then unclot on the next injection. This effect can be greatly amplified by the presence of a bubble inside cartridge, because in makes cartridge content more compressible. I've seen this with my short-acting insulin."
LL-B,2022-05-01,1,The last few boxes of my insulin (5 come in a box) at least one pen malfunctions and does not work at all. Super annoying and frustrating.
blazblu82,2022-05-01,1,"OP, are you using the U100 or U200 pen? The U200 pen is twice the insulin per unit versus U100. One plunger might move a bit more than the other."
anderson1496,2022-05-01,1,U-100. Always have used this one too.
antrich2003,2022-05-01,1,"Ive had Humalog pens not dispense any insulin at all before. I had to crank the pen to 10-15 units and push to get it unstuck and visibility see the insulin leave the pen. Happens a bit more than it should I think,  but Ive never heard of a pen giving more than it should."
More_Sprinkles4247,2022-05-01,2,I've had the same issue with Humalog pens too.
anderson1496,2022-05-01,1,What about it dispensing more insulin than dialed? Is that possible? Or is there some sort of safety mechanism in place to ensure that doesnt happen?
antrich2003,2022-05-01,2,If a pen can under-dispense id assume it could over. Ive never experienced the latter though
SanDiegoMitch,2022-05-01,1,"It's impossible for the pen to give more than you dialed.
Except...

If you reuse pen caps, and the insulin crystallizes blocking the pen needle. You may try to give your self let's say 3 units and the pen instead pressurizes.

Later on you give yourself 10 units. The pen already is pressurized with 3, and the now 13 units is enough to ""Un Jam"" the blockage and you now get 13.

Always prime your pen and see insulin come out before injecting to avoid jams and air.

You can also check out a little park near there called Hemenway park where there are often bunches of Bighorn sheep just hanging around, do not mess with them as they will butt you lol.

38willthisdo,2022-04-27,1,"Be aware if you go hog-wild that sometimes digestion slows down and, ironically, you can experience a low blood sugar while youre carting around a food baby (if that happens try to treat with juice rather than food cause your stomach is already backed up with all the buffet food). I try to track my sugars throughout (cgms are great for this) so I can try to head off any lows from stuffed-belly syndrome. Sometimes you can split your insulin dose- some before you eat and some after so you dont have an insulin spike before the food is in digestion mode."
Sprig3,2022-04-28,1,"Bolus for your first 60g carbs right when you arrive at the restaraunt.

Then, estimate how much you are eating and bolus for 60g more carbs every 2 hrs until you've covered all the carbs (and fat) you think you ate.  Modify a bit based on actual blood sugar reading.

On a pump, I usually do something like this: 5 units right at first, then set up extended bolus of 2 units per hour for 4 hours.

Obviously, if you're planning on any physical activity at all (like even walking around or something), you'll need to modify based on that."
Steve_Kraus,2022-04-28,1,"I am a T1 with a pump, a CGM, and decades of experience. Here is how I handle a buffet. Do not go to buffets often. Moderation is required.

Do you have a pump and do you use a fast acting insulin? If so, I recommend a Dual wave bolus, with about 50% of your bolus now, and 50% in a square wave for 1 or 1&amp;1/2 hours.

Eat a small dessert first, and that dessert should be fruit with lots of roughage like berries or apples or pear. Do not eat ice cream or pies or sweet desserts with lots of calories. Pie or cake, just eat a small sliver. No more than 15 to 20 carbs. Why eat desert first? If you bolus lots of insulin, then eat a tremendous amount, you will slow down your digestion so that you could slip into low blood sugar.

Eat a salad second or along with the dessert. Fill up on veggies and fiber at the salad bar, so you will slow down your eating. Get full at the salad bar. Do they have soup? Usually that is not too high in carbs. 

Next comes the fun food plate. Take a plate and get only small portions and notice what you are eating. Eat lots of different foods and plan your last plate. Sample the variety of food at the deli. Do not really fill up this plate. Make a note of your favorite flavors. Sometimes I will take pictures of this plate. 

Wait for a while and drink a zero calorie beverage, like coffee or tea or diet pop. Talk with your friends or your date.

While everyone else is getting desert, go get a last dinner plate. For your last plate, go back and get small portions of the best tasting food that you sampled in the last plate. I usually go back and get some fish or soup or the roast, something that digests slowly.

I think back and remember what I ate. I love thinking about food. I will take mental notes of the best food at each deli. Sometimes I drift off to sleep remembering delicious food at a deli dinner. A deli will often have the same foods every day, so you can visit again. 

Test your blood sugar 2 or 3 hours after you finish eating, and take a little insulin if you feel high. You should have some glucose tablets with you if you are running low.

Only visit the deli as a special treat, but plan your visit."
itr110,2022-04-28,1,"Pre-shoot 50% of my regular meal amount at the beginning (10u for me), give additional for every plate.  Sure its more shots but takes away stress of over/under estimating.

ConcreteDonkey63,2022-05-16,3,"From a nutritional point it probably doesn't matter if you eat 100g per meal or 10g. Both can be healthy diets imo. High, moderate or low carb should be your choice but make sure you are informed on the pros and cons of each. 
 
In saying that, I would say at least try going low carb: 10-15g per meal and see how you go.

Generally you should find you make smaller errors with your doses meaning less time spent high and less low.

If you are honeymooning some lucky people can get away with no meal time insulin for some time. Also tight control can sometimes help prolong the honeymoon phase."

Now that Im older (21), Im not in as much of a rush to go to the pizza/pop/cake birthday parties that I did as a kid. I still dont limit myself or even aim for a set number of carbs, but I have learned to cut out certain foods that just arent worth it (white rice, chocolate milk, most cereals, some desserts, etc.). At this point, its more about eating a generally healthy diet and not restricting myself to a set of rules.

If you think you'll want more carbs in general going forward, I would say now is a good time to try and practice how to dose for them, but then you definitely might have to learn again later when you're not honeymooning."

Also, there's no reason you can't use both for the same sensor as far as I know. I typically use my phone to scan, like, all the time. But I like to use the scanner a couple times a day just in case one of them dies before I see my Doc next time"

However in the US you can only use one or the other, you cannot use the reader AND your phone to scan the same sensor. Whatever you activate with, youre stuck with for the duration of that sensor. 

My only complaint& with the reader device, you can turn off alarms& On the phone, you cannot disable critical alarms, they are LOUD and you cant adjust the volume, cant adjust the critical numbers for lows. I found a workaround for this on Reddit which is to force close out the app (instead of letting it run in the background). But its annoying when you get false lows in the middle of the night and the entire house is jolted awake from the sound."

Not_Stupid,2022-05-10,1,"Why does it even have a low glucose warning?  Like, I just scanned it, I can see the reading.  I don't need a special flag to tell me that's a low reading..."
Anonmom0410,2022-05-12,1,"The point is if youre insulin dependent and youre going low and you dont realize it, if you didnt just recently scan it& it will alert you. Same with going high, it can draw your attention to it so you can decide if you should take action. I see the benefit, especially if you dont feel lows, or in the middle of the night it can wake you to alert you of a critical low so you can get up and treat it and not risk it getting worse. Another benefit is if you are caring for someone else (I.e. your child at school), you can link to their app and get alarms for their lows& etc. 

However due to false compression lows, its not totally reliable for me to be interrupted at night."
Not_Stupid,2022-05-12,1,"&gt;  if you didnt just recently scan it& it will alert you

But it can't - unless you scan!  Libre2 doesn't have bluetooth or anything, it only gets data when you manually scan it."
Anonmom0410,2022-05-12,1,"It does have Bluetooth. You just have to scan to see the actual data. So it will alert you that it is low/high, and you scan to see what the actual numbers are.  The sensor stores up to 8 hours of data, and scanning it pulls that data into your app. Its my understanding that some other CGMs have the ability to show you real time data from the app without a scan. This does not do that, but it will still alert you to a low so that you can scan and take action."
Not_Stupid,2022-05-12,1,Huh.  So it does.
Anonmom0410,2022-05-12,1,"You cant& if you try to turn it off in the notifications setting, it will tell you you must allow critical alerts in order to use the app. Super lame. Doesnt make sense because you can turn it off on the reader device."

puehlong,2022-04-29,9,"One methodological issue was that before CGMs, there was no accurate way of measuring how long someone was above 121, or at a given level, or if their glucose was constantly fluctuating. So older studies used the A1c to measure correlation between glucose levels and diabetes related damages. 

CGMs are in principle available for a bit over 20 years, but I believe widespread adoption came much later. So even the best studies can only look at a max time range of 20 years to analyze diabetes related damages (which is less than the time I have diabetes, so they won't tell me my risk of getting any damages (so far I seem to be lucky)).

There are studies that show a strong correlation between the time in range where the range is usually defined as 70-180mg/dl. So first of all this means that the difference between 120 and 150 is not studied well (as far as I know, I have no systematic overview of the research data). But it would also imply that you don't do much damage to your body if you were at only 180 for a couple of hours. Of course this should probably be combined with the A1c reading, meaning if you are constantly at 180, you might be 100% in range, but your A1c would be approximately 7.9 which lies at a level where you run an increased risk of damaging your body.

However, even at the highest levels of time in range, the probability of diabetic complications are not zero and I didn't find good sources detailing how big the difference between being in the range of 70-180 or 70-120 really is."
buffyswing,2022-04-29,5,"I have a variation on this question. Since being diagnosed, I've had 3 endocrinologists (due to practice or insurance changes) plus my regular doctor talk to me about this, and I've also done a ton of reading online (like most of us). There seem to be 2 schools of thought:  
One says that anything over 160 starts to do damage, and that the more time you spend below this, the safer you are. And, obviously, the higher you go, the more damage you're doing. So you're better off staying at 140-150 all day (high protein and veggies and fats, as few carbs as possible) than have a meal where you spike to 250 but then 2 hours later drop down to 110 as the insulin and meds kick in.  
The other school says that even at 150 your doing minute damage and it adds up over time, because you're forcing your body to constantly be producing insulin as the body is slowly digesting that meal, and the more time you spend in the normal range, the better, even if you have a peak or two per day above 175-180. They are the ones who recommend more whole grains in the diet, despite it not being lo-carb anymore.

For me, because I don't know what to believe anymore, and because as I get older (I'm 61, Type 2 for about 10 years now, A1C was always below 6.0 on meformin but now I'm at 6.0 on 2000 mg per day), I'm discovering that I need to have a little bit of carbs with each meal in order to 'trigger' my insulin production (like, half a piece of bread with lean meat/fish and veggies) and avoid fatty foods like bacon and steak, and to eat smaller meals. My clue is that when I finish eating, I should still be a little hungry. It sucks, but it seems to be working, especially with dinner. My stomach is growling when I go to bed, but my morning numbers have dropped from 140 to 115 and my A1C went from 6.3 a year ago to 6.0 last week. \*I've only been doing this new diet for 5 months. No weight loss, just different portioning and choices.\*  
This is the big problem with diabetes - it affects us all differently. We each have to find what works for us to keep the A1C as low as possible. I figure that if they say normal is anything below 120, then anything above that is doing damage. Our job is to minimize the damage, which means sticking as close to 120 or lower as many hours a day as we can, and if we go higher, keep that as low and short as possible. 4 hours at 150 vs 1 hour at 200 is probably the same in how it affects the cells of the body."
dopaminetract,2022-04-29,5,"Here's a chart that maps your risk of *diagnosable* medical complications against your A1c. I think this is a helpful way of making sense of it. Keeping your A1c levels in the 5s and 6s, so roughly a baseline of &lt;150 mg/dL or &lt;8mmol, puts you at basically the same risk as the general population for microalbuminuria (blood protein showing up in your urine, an early warning sign for vascular complications), neuropathy (nerve damage e.g. numbness and tingling in extremities), nephropathy (kidney damage), and retinopathy (eye damage).

mckulty,2022-04-29,3,"""Normal"" is a curve.

If you want hard rules and absolutes, you find those in religion.

Biology is all bell-shaped curves. ""Damage"" is related to the area under the curve... how high, MULTIPLIED by how long.

Also When you wake up at 180, you haven't probably been 180 all night."

EstimateWilling7263,2022-04-29,5,"False, being in the 80's most of the time with spikes only as high as 120 mg/dl post prandial would give you an A1C around 4.5 which is well below what a normal, average person has at around 5.2 A1C."

I don't know where he got this information or how valid it is.  But he told us that at around 200 mg/dl is when damage starts happening to blood vessels.    So as a general rule he tells his patients to try and stay below 200 as much as possible."
jeffbell,2022-04-29,2,"Here's my unsupported hypothesis....

On the microscopic scale we are all of us both suffering damage and healing everyday and at every sugar level.  It's just that the balance tilts the other way depending on the level, and age, and general health."
SgtSloth,2022-04-29,3,"I am under the belief that it is different for everyone. Of course the answer is to keep it in a good range (80-120) and that's gonna be your best chances... BUT, I ran in the 200-350 range for nearly 20 years... And I am paying for it.  


THAT SAID THOUGH... My complications are numb feet/legs, digestion problems, early arthritis, sexual problems. BUT my eyes have miraculously not changed since I was in my 20's (i'm now 41). So it just hits everyone different and there is no quantified objective answer to this.  I've seen diabetics with terrible eye trouble that has had better control than I did. I have seen diabetics on dialysis and failed kidneys. I also know several diabetics that don't have any real serious complications that don't take great care of themselves. It's totally just different for everyone.  


Just don't be like me cuz you will hate yourself for most of your life for being stupid and not taking care of yourself."
vastmagick,2022-04-29,0,There is no study that goes into that level of detail(or in my opinion that ever will be done in our lifetimes).

Worried_Shallot_7526,2022-04-29,2,"To be honest I cant remember when or which Youtube Video it was by Dr Berry I think I viewed it a couple years ago &amp; He literally has so many YouTube Videos - So I am sorry about that.

However Diabetes Self Management (also using US figures) supports Dr Berry by stating that Post-meal blood sugars of 140 mg/dl [milligrams per deciliter] and higher, and fasting blood sugars over 100 mg/dl [can] cause permanent organ damage and cause diabetes to progress, Ruhl writes.

Glucose can also start killing beta cells at levels below 140. One study found that people with fasting blood glucose from 110125 (within the official prediabetic range) had already lost up to 40% of their beta cell mass

I personally always try &amp; keep my fasting levels between 4 - 5.4mmol/L (72 - 97.2 mg/dl) &amp; 2hr postprandial Meal BGLs to &lt; 7mmol/L* ideally 5.4*- 6.0*mmol/L - which would give a HBA1C of 5.4 - 6.0%

drugihparrukava,2022-04-29,1,"Oh i dont seem to have functional beta cells as a type 1 lol. Im just wondering as spikes can happen for a variety of reasons or 42 reasons as we know, and have never found an answer if it means a 5 minute spike or if were stuck at a high for 2 hours, all day etc? I have a1cs in the 5s but TIR can change due to so many things. My target range is 3.9-5.8 but life and type 1 interfere with that ;)

So I guess my question is: Is there a measurable time that organ or capillary damage occurs? If my bolus is off for anaerobic exercise and Im stuck well over 7 for an hour for example. Im sick this week and not responding to any pump changes and added IM shots to get me down but I keep creeping up, how is this mitigated and measured? Its hard to find answers.

Have you done a basal test to check that your basal is correct during the day? Also if you're having your basal at night, it's probably running out right before your main meal of the day which won't be helping. Do a basal test to check what's going on when you don't eat. It may be that you need to split your levemir. For some people, they only get around 16 hours out of it and almost no one gets 24 hours."
pancreaticallybroke,2022-05-02,5,"Basically, you need to nail your basal as much as possible before you start worrying too much about your meals. 

Once you've sorted your basal, that's when you work on the bolus. With novorapid you will definitely need to pre bolus though. Working out the timing of it will take a little bit of trial and error. If you have anything that's high fat you will probably need to split bolus. Some people also have to do this with anything high carb. 

If you Google how to basal test, there should be some decent results. If you're in the UK, let me know and I'll send over some links."
rileyyy124,2022-05-02,4,"Thankyou for such a comprehensive answer! You made everything easy to understand. And i am yet to do a basal test for my lunch. 

Do you think its worth it to write to my doc about changing my insulin? I was on a premixed insulin before with humalog as its fast acting component and it really did work well but eventually i couldnt stay on it for obvious reasons."
pancreaticallybroke,2022-05-02,3,"I'd definitely recommend basal testing. Ideally, you should repeat each time segment three times. I usually do one meal a day when basal testing but appreciate that this can be difficult. Ideally you should just consume water during these tests as things like caffeine can also have an impact. If I'm testing over my evening meal time then I'll usually just have my breakfast and then nothing all day. It can take our bodies six hours to fully digest food so I'd rather have nothing in my system. 

With the insulin, it's really down to personal choice and your doctor's recommendation. I'm on Novo rapid and have been for around twenty years now. It has its issues but it's been reliable and consistent for me. Fiasp has been known to stop working as well after a few months and lumjev (that's definitely spelt wrong) is a little thicker/sticker and doesn't always play well with insulin pumps. Although novorapid can be slow, I would rather have something that's consistent. I know exactly how it behaves in my body. You could switch to a faster insulin but those do have their issues too. For example if you're having something that's really high fat, you sometimes have to delay your insulin until a while after you've eaten or you go hypo. The bolus insulin you use isn't that important, it's just important to know how it acts in you. Once you've nailed your basal, wait until you're on a day where you aren't doing any activity and your bloods are stable and then inject a couple of units and test your sugar every 3-5 minutes. This will show you roughly how quick your insulin works in you. It will probably be different at different times of the day and you may find that the higher you are to start off with, the longer it takes but it will give you a rough idea. 

Once you've done really thorough basal testing and you know what your needs are at all times of the day, it may be worth speaking to your doctor about swapping out your basal. If you need different amounts overnight compared to during the day then levemir is the winner because you can split your dose and have more/less in morning/evening. If you're consistent with your needs then it's worth switching to one of the longer acting ones like tresiba because it's much smoother and tends to give you better control overall."
rileyyy124,2022-05-03,2,"Hi, so everybodies advice did help a lot and i prebolused for my meal which helped reduce my initial spike and postprandial blood sugar levels. It got me down to a nice 120mg/dl but it shot right back up to 190 again in the next hour. I usually just have a whole wheat flat bread with some curry, no significant fat or protein but it still manages to climb up. I could try upping my basal but with the dose im currently at, it drops me immensely at night and i have to keep waking up and snacking through the night. However it doesnt do much to keep me stable between meals (all 3). It sounds more like a basal problem right? Or maybe novorapid just leaves my system way too fast ="
pancreaticallybroke,2022-05-03,2,"Yeah it sounds more like basal. It sounds like you need a split dose with more in the morning than at night. Do a couple of basal tests and then take the info to your doctor and discuss whether a split dose would be better for you. 

Whole wheat stuff can take a while for your body to get the carbs out of it so it may be that your novo is running out before all your carbs are dealt with. Maybe try white bread instead. You'll probably get a faster initial spike though so prebolusing is essential. The other thing that's worth trying is freezing your bread and then either defrosting it and cooling it or cooking it from frozen. I can't for the life of me remember why this helps other than it does something to the molecular structure of something in the bread. Many people find that they don't spike nearly as much with bread that's been frozen. The same goes for pasta. I now stick to frozen white bread because it's easier to manage."
Abra-Krdabr,2022-05-02,6,"Having a good I:C ratio will help a lot. Not all meals can be covered with the same amount of insulin unless its the exact same number of carbs, fat, and protein every time. But even then, diabetes is weird and some foods are going to affect you differently even if they have the same macros as something else. For example, 1 serving of corn flakes spikes me to the moon, but a serving of Rice Krispies does not. I take the same amount of insulin for both."
rileyyy124,2022-05-02,1,"Thankyou, i will definitely keep that in mind!"
KokoPuff12,2022-05-02,2,"This sounds like a question of both timing and amount.  The insulin probably won't start working at all until at least 20 minutes after dosing.  If you get a spike and it comes back down, that's timing.  But, you are also requiring a correction, which indicates that the amount of insulin given is not sufficient.  If you are afraid to pre-bolus all of it, try pre-bolusing some of it.  But, know that the amount is probably more than 5 units for your chosen meal, and will vary depending on the carbs, fat, and protein in the meals."
rileyyy124,2022-05-02,1,"I will definitely try upping my dose. However i started with 7u of novorapid but not only did it cover my meal but also dropped me like an extra 50mg/dl so i reduced it to 5u to just cover my carbs (but when im high i do add in a couple units more to correct for it with my regular 5units.) However the problem is, id reach a good blood sugar level 2 hours after eating but immediately spike right back up to, say, 200mg/dl :/"
KokoPuff12,2022-05-02,3,"This could be a basal issue, or could be fat and protein. Like pancreaticallybroke said, nothing works until basal is correct. Basal should hold you steady in the absence of food, activity, and active insulin"
StrangerGlue,2022-05-02,3,"That's what the hospital had my mom doing, a set dose bolus + a correction if she was high before the meal. They were doing it because they didn't trust her to eat everything bolused for.

Her estimated A1C dropped 1.5% in 3 weeks by just guessing at a carb ratio at home, instead of a the set dose at meals.

I got our starter ratio by counting how many units of fast acting she used the day before (set dose + corrections) and divided that by the number of grams of carbs she had eaten that day.

So if on Monday she used a total of 30 units fast acting and ate 120 carbs, 30 / 120 = 0.25

On Tuesday, if breakfast had 55 carbs, did (55 * 0.25 = 13.75) and bolused  14 units (if concerned, you could round down instead!). Checked BG at 1 hour and 2 hours after eating for corrections if needed.

At the end of Tuesday, I check her daily ratio and think about if her sugars readings were better or worse than Monday's. Then I adjust the ratio up or down from that.

By the end of the week, we'd found a pretty solid number, and it was way less scary than I thought it would, because she started getting the same ""insulin per carb"" as she was with the other system. She was just getting the insulin sooner."
KokoPuff12,2022-05-02,2,"So, maybe 6 is the answer for that meal. Or, you may want to talk to your endo about pens that will dose half units. The, you could try 5.5, 6, and 6.5, if you knew 7 was too much."
ChronicallyIllBadAss,2022-05-02,2,I have been having the same problem!!! Thank you for the post so I can also get advice
diabeartes,2022-05-02,1,"This won't answer your question, however fwiw i was never successful with the Levemir/Novorapid combo until I switched to FIASP. Have you tried that? It's faster acting for boluses."
rileyyy124,2022-05-02,2,"I was on a premixed insulin my whole life before this, im 22 now so no i havent but i will def mention it to my doctor. Thankyou!"
diabeartes,2022-05-02,1,"Sounds good. Just to be clear, FIASP is really Novorapid but a faster-acting version. It has helped me enormously, however I also switched to a pump at the same time."
diabeartes,2022-05-03,1,"One other comment, and it may again not be the case, but if you really want to troubleshoot, something i've posted in other threads is that great depends on the specific vial of the insulin that I'm using.  I have had some vials of Novorapid (FIASP in this case) where no matter what I did, my highs were always high, when I knew it wasn't supposed to be.  I attributed it to the vials being too cold, i tend to keep my fridge colder because I like cold juice and fruit and milk etc, and it's where the vials are kept too, albeit on the door.  If the cartridge for the insulin isn't completely clear, I'm skeptical of its pending efficacy so within a day or to if it's no good, I usually chuck it out.  Of course this is not always feasible.  In any event since it sounds you use MDI and not a pump, then YMMV."
Dis0rderlyConduct,2022-05-12,8,Save them as a backup incase your pump goes down.
phatpug,2022-05-12,3,"My kid has been on a pump for a few years, and we get a couple pens each year for just this purpose.  It's always a good idea to have a backup plan.  Additionally, they typically go to the waterslides or water park a couple times a year and we disconnect them from the pump for the day and use a pen."
Dis0rderlyConduct,2022-05-12,1,Yea that's a good plan no doubt.
surfwacks,2022-05-12,1,"I do plan to keep a few on hand :) I will probably donate a lot of my toujeo and my old (unexpired) Novolog pens, I plan to keep the Lyumjev ones"
Dis0rderlyConduct,2022-05-12,4,"Keep all of them. You're not selfish for doing it, in this day in age with uncertainties like supply chain issues having as much stock on hand is ideal. They're already paid for, if an emergency arises you'll be thankful you have them."
surfwacks,2022-05-12,5,"Thats true. Maybe when theyre closer to expiring I can donate them a couple months out if I have more on hand, right now Im set for a year or two"
Dis0rderlyConduct,2022-05-12,1,That sounds like a good plan.
chronically-clumsy,2022-05-12,3,"You have a couple options. 

1) keep a few pens as backup. My endo actually prescribes them for me inc see my pump fails.

2)pull the insulin from the pens with a syringe to use in your pump

3) put a needle on the pen and inject the insulin into a vial. This probably goes against every doctors advice because of the risk of bacteria but it is by far the easiest option to use pens in a pump"
surfwacks,2022-05-12,2,"The third option sounds pretty interesting. Would I just find an old empty insulin vial to use, or is there a way to order clean empty vials? Also would it be a good idea to use an alcohol swab on the pen needle before injecting it (sorry if thats dumb lol I honestly dont really use alcohol wipes before injections)"
buzzybody21,2022-05-13,3,You can fill your pump using pens&youre good!
cmhbob,2022-05-12,2,"You should be able to withdraw the lyumjev from the pens and use it in your pump if they authorize it; I've heard of people using that in the pump.

If you don't use it, there are almost certainly local healthcare clinics that would accept it as a donation."
surfwacks,2022-05-12,2,"Thanks! I do plan on donating most of my toujeo (keeping some in case the pump goes down) and all my Novolog pens I dont use anymore. Im going to hang on to Lyumjev for now and try it with the pump, Im sure Ill feel more comfortable after I get some training on it"
cmhbob,2022-05-12,1,"Hold on to the Novolog until you find out what you'll be using in the pump. Whatever you use, you can withdraw from the pen just like you would from a vial. That's what I did for the first 3-4 weeks was to pull from my Novolog pens."
lafilleimpossible,2022-05-13,2,"You should NOT fill your t:slim cartridges with anything but Humalog or Novolog; those are the only two insulins that actually work with their cartridges. Because of the design of them, other insulins are not able to be maintained in the cartridge without crystallizing. When I first was on the t:slim I was using Apidra and had soooo many problems for so long and could not understand why until finally a Tandem employee told me why.

Soo in short, keep them as back up insulin in the case of pump or site failure but dont put it in your t:slim because it will just be a waste."
surfwacks,2022-05-13,2,"Good to know, thanks. Maybe my body will like Humalog or Novolog more when its given through a pump, could be worrying about nothing lol"
surfwacks,2022-05-13,2,"I forgot to ask, what are the negative side effects of the cartridge crystallizing? What issues were you having if you dont mind me asking :)"
lafilleimpossible,2022-05-13,2,"No I dont mind at all! We gotta stick together and share our knowledge! :)

So I was having occlusion issues because the insulin was crystallizing in the cartridge after only about a day or so which not only caused my sugars to be crazy high but also made it so I was having to change the cartridge at least once a day, if not multiple times a day because I kept getting occlusion alarms. It was so frustrating going through a month of supplies in about a week and dealing with the high blood sugars."
surfwacks,2022-05-13,2,"Oh jeez, that sounds awful! Thanks for sharing! I know I definitely cant afford wasting supplies like that"
lafilleimpossible,2022-05-13,2,"Yeah it was frustrating as hell and I also couldnt afford to go through supplies like that! Luckily Tandem has really great customer service and they sent me replacements for all the cartridges I wasted, but it was still an annoying experience that I wish I never had to go through, diabetes is hard enough! So at the very least I definitely dont want anyone else to go through the same bullsh*t if it can be avoided."
surfwacks,2022-05-13,1,"Ahhhh I see. I read some articles theyre trying to approve Lyumjev for the pump, just dont know which brand of pump lol. Hopefully one day well get more selections to choose from!"
ChickenBeans,2022-05-12,1,I forgot my vial at omnipod training so my nurse pulled the insulin out of my pen with the syringe... said it would just take a lil extra effort to get the bubbles out (extra tapping on syringe before injecting into pod : )
surfwacks,2022-05-12,2,I wonder if its a similar process for the tslim. I think Ive seen posts about it in here but theyre hard to understand since Ive never even seen a pump irl lol :)

Matezza,2022-05-21,1,Illness and injury can lead to high BG. I've never really experienced it but covid hit me likema truck. It's important to check for ketones if you can get you BG down. Even if you aren't eating anything your BG can still rise.
InsaneChihuahua,2022-05-21,1,Oh yeah getting sick will screw your bg up so much.
NEXT_VICTIM,2022-05-21,1,"Any illness can cause loss of control, the body is fighting and not focusing on regulating things as much.

profkimchi,2022-05-22,1,"Being ill can raise BG and decrease insulin sensitivity. So, yes, its normal."
breebop83,2022-05-22,1,"As others have stated being sick can definitely make your sugars spike. COVID actually had the opposite affect on me after the fever stopped. I upped my long acting while sick and all the sudden was having super lows (no fever but still having symptoms for about a week). Corrected it back to my usual and had some of my best numbers ever. My cousin (also T1) had a similar exp- may depend on the strain, I believe we both had omicron. 

Diabetes is weird and its best to be on top of  checking numbers when ill to avoid other issues and recover more quickly (Ive found keeping my numbers as stable as possible helps with that). 

You might try calling your gp/endo and requesting a phone consult for extra advice on dosing."

GoldPenalty7702,2022-05-17,2,"I'm with you, an insulin pump has made my life so much easier. I was afraid to get it for a long time but it makes life more manageable and my A1C went way down because you can control your blood sugar better."
katiejd1988,2022-05-17,3,"I was on injections for 18 years? It worked and worked with my life&granted my teen years I didnt do what I needed to. Happy to report, I have zero complications and went on the tslim pump 9 years ago? The new system is amazing my last A1c was 5.6 on 4/13. I love this pump with my dexcom. I know people are afraid of having tubing, something attached, Ive ripped it out once. Its so normal for me I dont know any different. Get a pump if you can!"
nallvf,2022-05-17,6,"I don't eat them, myself. 

Otherwise you'd need to dose for them, or split up your doses (one for the chips one for the meal), or ignore them and roll the carbs into your meal and tolerate the potential high, or take the meal insulin early and tolerate the potential low."
SupportMoist,2022-05-17,4,"Oh rolling them into the meal sounds like a good idea, since I wouldnt be too high for too long right? And I didnt know you could split doses, I was told if I take insulin I cant take take more for 2-3 hours! So many rules."
fourpenguins,2022-05-17,4,You can totally split doses for meals or snacks. What you shouldn't do is correct for high blood sugar if you've taken insulin in the last ~3 hours (because the first insulin isn't done yet). This is something that doctors and diabetes educators are awful at explaining for some reason.
Diabeetus_guitar,2022-05-17,1,This is also why a pump is so wonderful. You can dose for a high while you still have insulin working in your system because it factors that in for you.
B4by20_,2022-05-17,2,"There is no rules. The people who made the rules arent type 1. &amp; most quite literally have no clue what theyre talking about LOL the only rules are juice when going low, insulin, water&amp; rest when going high."

AlexLeeDunn,2022-05-17,3,"Honestly, I just dose when I order. The chips will keep you from dipping if dinner happens to take longer than expected. In most cases you aren't going to drop dangerously before the meal arrives. Realistically you should dose 10 - 20 before eating. Most resturants ticket times are in that range. You'll get more confident with time."
Th4n4n,2022-05-17,3,"As a type one it's all about cost benefit analysis. You have to decide which is more important to you, maintaining perfect (or as good as you can) numbers, or enjoying life and eating the chips.


I've been type 1 for 30 years, and I eat some of the chips. Don't go crazy, take an extra unit or two for the meal after you order. 


If you get a pump that makes it easier.

Bbkinz7,2022-05-17,1,I usually take a unit or 2 right when I get there to handle the pre meal beer/chips. Then take my actual meal insulin when the food gets there. I don't trust waiters when they say the meal is coming soon. I never want to chance them messing up my meal and getting stuck without food.
Mudtail,2022-05-17,1,"I usually split dose, but be sure you monitor closely if you do that"
Run-And_Gun,2022-05-17,1,"Two things: 1) check into getting an insulin pump.  It makes life so much easier, especially in eating out situations. And 2) You should bolus before you eat, otherwise you are probably going to be playing catch-up and spiking.  A general guideline is 20 minutes before you start eating.  Remember, insulin is not instant.  One of the hardest things for me to do, has been to bolus before a meal if/while Im low.  But my endo told me to treat the low(I take glucose tabs, usually) and then bolus.  Bolusing at least 20 minutes before I eat has helped me drastically cut post meal spikes."
Girlygabenpepe,2022-05-17,1,I just inject twice if it takes too long but usually I start eating the stuff a little to know if I like it/how much I will eat and then inject
jenana__,2022-05-17,1,"Alcohol doesn't even it out. Not at all. By the way, the effect of alcohol depends on the drink. A few glasses a beer definitely won't make you go higher, but lower. At least for me, wine doesn't do anything at all. It's mostly the ""hard"" drinks (or big amounts) that might get you down after a while.

I don't take insulin in a restaurant before I have my meal in front of me. Multi-courses (or bread before the first course) -&gt; multiple doses of insulin."

jenana__,2022-05-22,25,"It's not really about a healthy choice. Honestly that doesn't matter, your body has different needs compared to food coming from meals. Low -&gt; you need the glucose + that's it, you don't need anything else.

If you stick to conquering a low with the right portion (usually that should be 15g glucose; check again in 15 minutes): it doesn't matter. Glucose tablets or a small can of cola is fine. Brush your teeth if you want to be healthier.

Everything else while you're low is redundant. Everything more is excessive. It's not the time of the day when your body is gonna care about properly dealing with food intake."

GothamsPrincess,2022-05-22,1,"Yeah I know its not really about healthier eating, I was just curious =

Steve_Kraus,2022-05-22,3,"I like grapes too, but I have a tendency to eat too many.  Candy bars and desserts are too big and  have way too many calories. I have also tried ice cream, using a gram scale to calculate portion size. The amount of ice cream that I got to eat was so small that it was a disappointment.

I want a food with some sugar, but also some starch, and it should be easy to measure. So I have settled on Honey Nut Cheerios. I just weigh out a small portion of them, calculating from the amount of sugar I need and the nutritional labeling. And I eat them one at a time in a couple minutes. A box of them will last many months, because they don't tempt me."

TRIK-E,2022-05-23,1,Does your pump alert you before a hypo might happen? I reckon setting your low alarm at 4.5 is too low. By that time if youre heading down it doesn't give you much time to react. I have an alert when my graph trend appears as heading towards hypo as well as At hypo (but my warning signs still kick in anyways).

MarcusForrest,2022-05-23,1,"Honestly, if it is to treat a low blood glucose event only, **just use the quickest and simplest carbohydrate possible**

&amp;nbsp;

Low BG is an emergency, and you have to correct it as soon as possible - so use fast acting, simple carbs.

&amp;nbsp;

* Juice box 
 * Easy to carry, store, use - on average, a 200ml box contains 20g of fast-acting carbs
* Dextrose tablets
 * Easy to carry, store, use - on average, a single tablet contains 4g of fast-acting carbs _(you typically have to consume 4-5)_
* Sweets and Candies
 * I go for those that are nearly only sugar, such as Airheads (10g of carbs for the small ones) or Skittles (about 1g per 2 skittles)

&amp;nbsp;

At work, I have a container of **Gatorade Powder** - I simply have to mix 1-1.5 tablespoon(s) of powder with water, and it is fast acting carbs that'll quickly fix my low blood glucose. 1 tablespoon is about 15 grams of carbs

&amp;nbsp;

In this specific context _(fixing a hypo)_ - the ''quality'' of the sugar is pretty much irrelevant, so go for any quick acting sugar to fix you up as fast as possible."

I let myself have a treat now and then, but am very careful."
GoldPenalty7702,2022-05-19,5,And the more insulin (and food) I use for an indulgence once in a while makes me gain weight. But then you can always exercise a little more.
zeek_smol,2022-05-19,12,"Yes, that's fine. I'm a type 1 and that's literally how I eat every meal. Calculate I:C ratio, calculate carbs in the food, dose and go about my day. I would work with your care provider to solidify your plan however. If they tell you to ""Just take X amount of insulin and eat X amount of carbs per meal"" find a new doctor."
AeroNoob333,2022-05-19,1,"This! I honestly dont eat much differently than pre diagnosis. I was already counting macros for 2 years before I was diagnosed. Now, I just shoot insulin based on my IC ratio. It was annoying at first, but its pretty normal now."

Please talk to a doctor about what youre doing before you possibly use insulin incorrectly. Going too low by giving too much insulin is a thing and can be quite dangerous."
nrgins,2022-05-19,2,Not to mention that her doctor told her to take metformin sustained release after each meal. Sustained release is a 24 hour medication. No purpose in taking it after meals. Sounds like this doctor doesn't know what they're doing.
TummyDrums,2022-05-19,2,"Really you can eat whatever you want and take the correct amount of insulin to cover it.  The only important thing is keeping your blood sugar in range.  The hard part is that the more carbs/sugar you eat, the more difficult it is going to be to dose and time your insulin correctly.   That's why I tend to eat low carb and don't have to use as much insulin.  This helps me be very successful at keeping my BG in range.  I still splurge occasionally on pasta or something, but sometimes when I do that I hit my insulin perfectly as keep a flat line under 150 mg/dl but other times I miscalculate or don't take my shot early enough and shoot up to 300 mg/dl for a time period."
AeroNoob333,2022-05-19,2,"I do. Whenever Im on vacation, I eat more dessert than usual. I just take another shot to cover the carbs of what I think that dessert will have. Having MyFitnessPal helps at least estimate foods.

You need to figure out your IC ratio and correction factors. Your doctor should be able to give you some initial numbers that may need some tweaking. Start counting carbs properly and with enough practice and experience, you can honestly eat whatever you want."
GrumpyKitten1,2022-05-19,2,As someone type 2 extra carbs too often makes my symptoms worse (if you are insulin resistant it's best to minimize how much insulin you need) so I limit to special occasions (I'm planning to eat regular cake at my wedding but for my birthday I bake keto carrot cake). I've been finding keto recipes for things I'm craving so I can have the taste with less carbs (you don't need to be on the keto diet to use their recipes for lower carb alternatives).

dcwsaranac,2022-05-19,1,"My GP put me on a similar regiment when I was first diagnosed. I struggled and struggled with BG control.  GP fired me as a patient for not having better control (he was focused on practice metrics more than patients).  

I share this to say that my next GP was pissed when he saw what the first GP put me on.  My new GP got me with an educator, dietician, and endocrinologist.  I was taught how to count carbs, and put on a sliding scale.  HUGE difference, and with that knowledge I am occasionally able to have a sweet.

Swiftlock,2022-05-12,3,"In my experience theyve never stopped filling my prescription directly if ive missed appointments. Ive gone a whole year without a face to face and they'd still fill them, but they'd usually make me call and request a refill and then make me set up an appointment. I used to be real bad about posponing appointments so thats why. But once you get into a office for the first time they usually wont stop filling it since it could threaten your well being. They just make it harder."
Kathw13,2022-05-12,0,"It is the only way they get paid for their time. When I ask for refills or help, I always offer to come in. Maybe why I am told I are their favorite patient.  The pandemic has changed that and I have done from telemedicine appointments but that misses a lot.

WiseFatMatt,2022-05-12,2,"Me too. I pay very little for supplies outside the deductible. 

But folks shouldn't have to rely on the largesse of their employer to get access to medical care. Companies fold all the time, or they tighten their belts and decide to switch their insurer to decrease costs. 

Years ago I got laid off and had switch jobs and on my second day on the new job I was hospitalized with DKA. I hadn't been diagnosed with diabetes and I hadn't realized what my symptoms were. Between COBRA and the hospital bill, it was 4000 or so dollars.

Private healthcare can have pockets of good coverage, but it's no substitute for actual universal care. 

Sorry for the rant. Just wanted to remind folks of the cracks people can fall through."

For low carb sliced bread, I go with Sara Lee honey wheat - the one that is 19g for two slices. There are a couple varieties in this line, but that is the variety that my family will also tolerate as basic sandwich bread. They all have about the same carbs for 2 slices. 

For bagels, I used to love Thomas' cinnamon raisin bagel thins, but they stopped making that variety during the pandemic. Was about 24g for the whole thing I think. They still make plaina nd everything, but that wasn't what I wanted in the morning.

Now, I use Dave's Killer Raisin Bread. 19g for 1 slice, but whole grain and pretty thick. That's my go to breakfast bread atm. Closest replacement I have found for the bagel thins.

I really want to bring my numbers down but since I have family history of diabetes, I'm afraid nothing I do will bring my a1c down. I just wish my goal of delaying onset of diabetes isn't hopeless."
tom4705,2022-05-10,4,"Yes, I do have a family history of diabetes on my mothers side, along with a number of other health issues.  Your goal of delaying the onset of diabetes is not just possible, but probable if you do the right things. 

First, get to a healthy weight/bmi if you aren't already. More important than the foods you're eating is that you minimize excess fat on your body. Being overweight is more of a risk factor for type 2 diabetes than any particular food. So, any method of eating that you find sustainable to get to or maintain a healthy weight is what you should stick to. 

Having said that, if possible and sustainable for you, I think an optimal diet for diabetes is a whole foods diet that consists primarily of fibrous, unprocesssed carbs like veggies, some fruit, beans, sweet potatoes, etc with small amounts of lean animal foods like sockeye salmon, shrimp, etc. I'd avoid any high fat products including and especially oil as well as white flour, sugar, soda, etc. 

Exercise is also extremely important, with plenty of water. 

That's the best advice I can give. Good luck friend, I hope you succeed with your goals."

No oils at all? I always thought a little EVOO was okay. Just got my A1c tested Friday and it is 6.0. I put on a ton of weight this last year and have been far too sedentary. hoping some diet and lifestyle changes can get me back to a normal range."
tom4705,2022-05-10,2,"In my view, oil, including extra virgin olive oil, is one of the worst foods you can eat. It's quite literally the most calorically dense food on the planet, making it by far the worst choice if you're trying to lose, or even maintain your weight. It also provides little to no satiety, and little to no nutrition compared to whole foods. For 120 calories worth of whole olives, you get far more nutrition and health benefits (and satiety) than you do from 120 calories from olive oil. 

I can't begin to tell you how much easier losing weight was and how much my life improved once I ditched the oil. To me its a no Brainer to eliminate it if one needs to lose weight."
greenpowerliving,2022-05-10,2,"Beware the keto brigade will be coming for you and your sweet potatoes and low fat! =
"
tom4705,2022-05-10,2,"The thing is, I'm not against healthy fats. I eat salmon and nuts full of omega 3 fats. But these things have protein and fiber which makes me full, which prevents me from overeating calories. I feel like for the vast majority of people keto is unsustainable in the long term and in general is a suboptimal way of eating....but like I said in my other post, reaching your desired calorie deficit/maintenance to maintain a healthy way in and of itself is more important than any one particular way of eating. So if keto is someone's jam, and they reach their goals that way, good luck to them. 


I personally will continue to eat my delicious sweet potatoes <`"
Stargazer_0101,2022-05-10,1,EVOO is more than okay. For you are educated and can use this. Canola oil and olive oil is fine also.
tom4705,2022-05-10,0,Strongly disagree for reasons stated in this thread.
Stargazer_0101,2022-05-10,0,"Have you been to a dietician? Could help you understand about using canola and olive oil, for they are healthier than vegetable oil. Where did you get your information that olive and canola oil is bad for you? I have never heard of this, for my dietician told me these oils are much better than vegetable oil, due to the fat and unsaturated fat in there. Please tell me where you got your information? Thanks"
tom4705,2022-05-10,1,"Dieticians do not understand modern nutrition and teach outdated concepts they learned years ago in school. Its a fact that oil is the most calorically dense food on Earth, 120 calories per tablespoon, and most consume way more than that through how much they actually pour on their foods and the processed foods they eat. It also has no fiber, little to no vitamins, and very little antioxidant properties compared to natural, whole olives. Yes, olive oil may be a lesser evil to other oils and butter, but if you have weight to lose, have a family history of diabetes, and generally want to be healthier, a lesser evil (which it hardly is) will not help you to achieve your goals. 

All of this information is public and free."

buzzybody21,2022-05-05,5,Something being vegan doesnt necessarily make it diabetes safe& (whatever that means) it just means the removal of all animal proteins.
reesecheese,2022-05-05,3,"In general, anything in a bakery is going to be high carb. You don't need a nutrition label to know bread, cupcakes, cookies, donuts are high in carbs. I'm gluten and dairy free and it doesn't mean the bakery I used to go to is okay for me now as a diabetic. All of the specialty options will also be more expensive."

Almond flour and sugar substitutes will cut carbs, but you may not be compatible with all of the ingredients involved. So, I would personally try it out after work, maybe on a Friday evening or Saturday to allow time for compensation of any belly surprise."

You can chat or email the bakeries to get a general idea of the type of ingredients they will use. Generally though if they don't advertise as keto, most baking goods will be high in carbs. If they were low carb or keto they would likely mention it, as it would promote sales as a selling point."
FBMBoomer,2022-05-06,1,Stick with taking the amount of carbs per day that you can count. The vegan backery is going to be a very high carb place and bad for your health. Keto baked goods are expensive. The ingredients are expensive. regular white flour is very cheap.

Was looking at the actual meter's manual and could not find it. Am I OKboomering this? The phone app is where I'd record those extra notes and the app would mix that info with the glucose readings in the charts?

If so, is there a PC interface as well?

Tks!"
Puffawoof2018,2022-05-25,2,"I have the true metrix air and after you test you can select if its before eating, after eating, exercise, feeling sick, taking meds, or other.

Its not exactly what you describe but I really like it"
GoodMoGo,2022-05-25,0,"Will look into it. Tks.

But, can you enter the exercise on its own, or does it have to be when testing? I used to keep track of how exercise would affect me right after, 1 hour, and 2 hours afterwards. That';s the kind of drill down I'm tryig to get back to."
Puffawoof2018,2022-05-25,2,"Im not sure I understand what you mean, are you just looking to log a time that you exercised? How are you keeping track of how exercise affects at those time periods if youre not testing then? You can only enter an event associated with a reading on the true metrix so youd have to test to log that that result correlated with exercise"
GoodMoGo,2022-05-25,1,"&gt;You can only enter an event associated with a reading

Yup. That's what all meters since that one work. I liked being able to enter an event, regardless of glucose test. Sometimes I'd work out but not test (strips were expensive), but I was able to enter the workout anyway. This way, when I tested \[a couple of hours\] later, the report would show the workout that had happened before, without a test."
Puffawoof2018,2022-05-25,2,you can always just test two hours after and flag it as exercise and know that that flag just means two hours after exercise or use the other flag for for other time periods after exercise

mystisai,2022-05-02,7,"Do you wait the 15 minutes between tests?

Do a finger stick, wait 15 minutes, then check the libre. They are measuring from different fluids and there is a bit of a time delay. It takes about 15 minutes for the interstitial fluids to catch up."
advictway654,2022-05-02,2,"Yes, Ive tried that and have the same issue.  Which reading should I use (BG or Libre)?  Should I just figure that the Libre is just always going to be higher than a BG reading and factor the difference as a calibration measurement?"
mystisai,2022-05-02,2,"Stick to one or the other. Testing too much muddies the waters.

The only time I do a finger stick is when the sensor is warming up so a reading is unavailable, and I feel hypo symptoms."
pasta4u,2022-05-02,2,"Remember both methods are in accurate up to 15% ,in either direction


 I measure my blood once or twice a day and then use the  Libre 15 minutes later and just do the mental calculations of the difference in my head all day."
pancreaticallybroke,2022-05-02,3,"I think it's worth pointing out here that your blood glucose meter isn't accurate either. All home blood glucose monitoring systems have an accepted margin or error. In most places this is around 15%. The only way of getting an accurate measurement is in a lab.

Do you use the control solution for you blood glucose monitor? Have you checked that it's performing within the correct range?

You can go with either your blood glucose monitor or the libre. Apart from checking in the first day and then around the end of the life of the sensor, I don't use my blood meter unless the result the libre gives me feels off. In the four years that I've been using it, my estimated a1c  has only ever been a couple of points off so I'm confident that in me, it's accurate."
advictway654,2022-05-02,1,I havent used a control solution for the monitor so Ill have to think about it.  My recent A1C lines up with my glucose testing so I am more Congo with those measurements.
diabeartes,2022-05-02,2,Yes and particularly for lows.
buzzybody21,2022-05-02,2,This is a pretty widely known issue for the libre in general.
AeroNoob333,2022-05-02,2,This is why Im always going to go with Dexcom until Libre adds in a calibration feature. The trends on both CGM is accurate. I know that its testing different fluids so there will be a difference but I would like my CGM to be in line with my glucometer. Dexcom allows me to calibrate it up to my glucometer so the readings are very similar (within 5-10) between my finger pricks and what my Dexcom says.
JanovPelorat,2022-05-02,2,"When I first started using the libre 2 I had this same issue, usually off by 30 or sometimes 40.  What I have found (not taking credit for it, learned it on this sub) is that if you install your new sensor a day before the old one runs out it will be much more accurate.  Don't scan the new sensor in until the old one runs out.  I have done this for the last three sensors and every one is usually within 15 of my finger sticks (after the first 12 hours or so at least).  Honestly, 20 off is not a huge amount.  I have found if a sensor is off, it is consistently off, so doing the math is not too bad."
jasmineglow,2022-05-02,1,Came here to say this. I learnt from the xDrip4iOS group the other day that libres do much better when they are allowed to soak in for 24hrs before you activate them.
thejadsel,2022-05-02,1,"It seems to be normal. Mine pretty consistently reads around 20-40 higher than the meter, even with stable fasting levels. (So, factoring out any bigger time lag effects.) Some sensors are worse for it than others, but it's always erring on the higher side rather than lower.

This seems to be an issue with Abbott's automatic calibration algorithm in the official app/reader more than anything else. I primarily use the Diabox app for full continuous readings, and it does allow for manual calibration against finger sticks. That ends up MUCH closer to meter readings at any given time. 

That said, Abbott's calibration issue doesn't seem to be that much of a practical problem normally. At least if it is looking pretty consistently off in one direction, maybe just keep that in mind for some mental adjustments. And of course double check with the meter if it's looking too screwy, before correcting based off what the Libre is telling you. Good luck!"
VladTepesDraculea,2022-05-02,1,"This happens to me (and even with higher gaps) when I hit a small blood vessel and taint the readings. If consisitent, I leave it be and check blood from time to time to see if mantains so and consider the difference on my calculations."
opsb,2022-05-02,1,"The libre 2 sensor is sold as self calibrating, unfortunately the reality is that is definitely not. Depending on the sensor or even how old the sensor is youll get very different numbers (+/- 30mg/dl). Youve got a couple of options, either take finger prick tests and just remember the difference and adjust in your head or you can try something like the miao miao which allows you to use different apps which do have calibration. Into the bargain you also get updates via bluetooth so it turns your libre into a full CGM. 

If youre technically minded there are other options out there that let you use the libre 2 sensor via bluetooth with other apps but unless youre a developer they arent really an option (I mention it on the offchance theres a developer that happens to read this)."
swright10,2022-05-02,1,I went back to finger testing because my insurance doesn't cover dexcom and the Libre 2 was always seemed off. It read 68 once while finger prick was around 100.

thejadsel,2022-05-19,2,"It seems to be a lot more common with lows, but I had that pretty much every night when my blood sugar was staying way too high. (Misdiagnosed at the time, so no insulin.)

Wouldn't be too surprised if fasting levels dropping into still high but lower ""false hypo"" territory while I was sleeping might have contributed to that. Best explanation I can think of, with no CGM at the time. It does sound like similar might be happening here, with the new insulin treatment. 

If so, as other people have said? OP, you may just need to ride it out for a while, until your system does have a chance to adjust to running off healthier glucose levels regularly. Those weird sweats really can suck to deal with in the meantime. Hopefully getting set up with the Libre will help you get a better idea what might be going on, though. Good luck!"

TobeyMagu1re,2022-05-19,3,"Could be a few things, and ill add to something you just recently commented:

1) Are you taking Metformin? I'm type 1 but was still prescribed Metformin for a bit and man I had the worst night sweats when I was taking it. Switched to an ER (Extended Release) and that improved things. Eventually just went off it cause it wasn't doing anything for me anymore.

2) You said your numbers were high for a long time. If you start to drastically change your BG, even though it's in a normal range, you can still experience hypoglycemic symptoms despite ***not*** actually being hypo. When I was diagnosed, my BG was like well over 1,000 and my A1C was &gt;15. Even though my BG for the first few weeks got down to like \~150-170, my sugars were so high for so long that I started experiencing hypoglycemic symptoms like excessive sweating, excessive hunger, fast heart rate, etc. 

&gt;Told me my body was getting used to it since its been in high numbers for a long time.

This is true. Some people adjust quicker than others. Shortly after starting insulin I actually had really severe blurry vision, almost to the point where I couldn't make out ***anything***. I couldn't read size like 30 font right in front of my face and I've had 20/20 vision my whole life. Took like \~3 weeks for that to go back to normal. It will def take some time for your body to get used to being in range again. Def bring up your concerns with your doctor, but you may just need a little more time of having better control for some of these symptoms to go away."
xolaura5,2022-05-19,1,"No metformin, i have the two insulins and then a cholesterol pill. I told the dr that metformin gave me bad stomach issues and he said it wasnt needed since Im on two insulins. 

I have the excessive sweating i can be sitting down and Ill just be sweating and Im always hungry. You would think i was pregnant or something lol =

He told me when I got diagnosed ""TAKE YOUR DAMN MEDS AND CHECK YOUR GLUCOSE LEVELS."" So I'm fighting through this because I don't want to end up in his shoe.

When I first started hitting the low 100s I felt like I had low sugar and it sucked. Now I can hit 80 and I'm fine. I wasn't sure if the sweating was menopause or ??? but now that I'm doing so much better I can keep my underwear on all night. They're dry! It's only been a few months for me. You can do it.

newnameagain2,2022-05-21,19,"Go to your local farm/feed/tack store. Buy a couple rolls of ""vet wrap"".

Vet wrap is stretchy and only sticks to itself. The tape needs a full wrap, opposite direction to the vet wrap, and it needs to end up sticking to itself.

tultamunille,2022-05-21,2,"I use SkinTac and a Tegaderm patch over the Omnipod, works pretty well, and might incorporate some Vet tape for my arms as an extra layer thanks to this post."
TheWalrus850,2022-05-21,2,I live in New Orleans (it's hot and humid) and box year round in a non-air conditioned gym.  Try the skin tac others are talking about but be careful because it'll last way longer than a site should.
AgreeableCar2833,2022-05-21,1,"I'm a swimmer and I've had my Dexcom last about a month or so on the usual. Its actually been so bad I'll soak and wipe with jojoba oil to help it come off when using skin tac because I'm a bit extreme with it.

So, first I clean the site with 2 or 3 alcohol wipes, let it dry, and then I rip open the Skin Tac wrapper in half so I don't have to touch the skin tac at all. Because >"". I wipe the skin tac about the size of my palm, let it get sticky and dry which takes about 5 seconds, and I put on the sensor. If it ever gets stuck, you can hold it really really still and hit it with something hard a firm right on the base and it'll dislodge normally. Usually. >#
I then wipe the Skin Tac again over the adhesive of the dexcom and really saturate almost to the sticky end of the sensor sight and let it get tacky about 20 seconds or so, then I place on the simpatch or whatever patch over it. In a jam I've even used KT tape which worked really well too. I don't use a pump but I'd imagine it being quite similar."
weRanimalcules,2022-05-23,1,"I run a lot and work on commercial fishing boats. I've tried all kinds of tape and wraps, which usually cut into my skin after a few hours. But lately I've had good luck with Skin tac and compression shirts. I like Under Armour's sleeveless compression shirts. They keep everything in place enough that the adhesive holds on, even when I'm soaked in sweat for several hours and jumping around. I definitely feel your pain on this."

DogKnowsBest,2022-05-22,1,"Metformin is known to have those side effects in a lot of people.  I started off with 1 Jardiance a day and 1000 mg of Metformin a day (4 capsules, 1 at a time through out the day) down to 1 Jardiance and 250 mg Metformin (1 capsule a day).  When that still caused issues, I moved from Metformin to Glipizide where the side effects are decidedly less for me.  So for the last 2 years, I've been on the lowest doses of Jardiance and Glipizide and manage my numbers quite well.  If Metformin is causing you that many issues, ask your doctor for alternatives."

BellChance8257,2022-05-24,3,Thank you very much
GoldPenalty7702,2022-05-25,3,And start moving
4thshift,2022-05-24,9,"Stay hydrated. Avoid sugars and any beverages that have sugar or calories. Cut back on white foods basically starches from rice, potatoes, wheat and corn (chips, bread, cereal, pasta). May be stick with proteins (meats, eggs, plant
proteins without a lot of starch) and nonstarchy veg (broccoli, green beans, cauliflower, green salads&)

If he can walk around a bit, that might be a little helpful  muscle contractions help reduce circulating glucose. 

You seem to say you have insurance, but need an approval  can you not get an approval?

Clearly doctor consult and lab order would be ideal and are top recommendation.

Glucometers are not perfect but you already have the ability to prove he has excessively high glucose. So, I dont know what else they are going to call it at repeated readings of 350+ mg/dL.

You could do an A1C test from Walmart off the shelf. It will give an average of his glucose for the past 3 months. Probably not as accurate as a blood draw.

There are online services where you could order your own tests in most of US. Cant tell you which to get but Diabetes #1 Baseline Blood Test Panel is about $65 at WalkInLab. Just an example, not an endorsement at all. Insurance would typically cover the costs better than paying with cash for online DIY service; but just saying there are alternatives to being stuck in red tape and permission from on-high.

You can go to a Minute Clinic type place at a local Pharmacy and ask for diabetes screening. Not free either.

You can find a Community Health Center and see if you qualify for low-income or uninsured services. 

https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/

None of that is going to specify the underlying reason why he might have diabetes, or what else might be going on. There are additional tests for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and also for the different autoimmune antibodies for Type 1.

Medication like metformin might be ordered and it is relatively cheap ($4/month) at some places like Walmart. But a prescription is probably needed. Insulin might be necessary, and none of us could begin to suggest you experiment with insulin, or any other medication without medical evaluation and supervision.

If he feels absolutely awful and his glucose is going above 400 mg/dL we are going to suggest you consider emergency care. A main threat is dehydration, so again water and maybe Zero Sugar electrolyte drink if you want.

Hate to tell you to pay full-price for lab tests, but that is probably less expensive than him ending up in an ambulance and ER, or worse. Maybe you can ask what is in the lab order and see what the doctor wants ordered."
Stargazer_0101,2022-05-25,2,"What country do you live in? Uk has access to health care. And the USA is horrible on health care. His doctor needs to get with the insurance company and explain the need for lab work for his diabetes. In the meantime, change the eating habits, less to no sugar, count the carbs and take short walks for the circulation of the heart and lungs. And 350 is not good for him. I pray that your doctor and God helps your husband soon."
cwidds20620,2022-05-25,2,"Drink lots of water. Reduce carb intake. Any sort of physical activity will help lower blood sugar, like a walk or jog. Hot tub is another way to lower blood glucose. 

Most importantly, these are only suggestions to hold him over until he can see a medical professional. If he gets above 400.. go to the emergency room. Diabetic ketoacidosis is no joke and waiting for a doctor isn't worth losing his life. I went into medical debt when I was diagnosed but eventually paid it off. I have my life and that's what's most important. 

Hope he gets the help he needs ASAP!="
EatABigCookie,2022-05-25,2,"I'm not a Dr so this is just my opinion, but It's probably type 1. Exercise and drinking water as others suggested won't cut it, he will (if he is T1)  need to get on insulin ASAP. Find medical care and make sure he is tested for T1. Not tomorrow, today.

If I understand your comment correctly, he lost over 10 percent of his body weight for no explained reason in 3 weeks... You are both in denial if you do not think that is an emergency. Sorry to be blunt, but I've been there and done that at a similar age and denial could of killed me."

An update. We were denied the lab benefit because the insurance company considers his situation a pre-existing condition, so we are paying out of pocket now.

DecadeMoon,2022-05-24,1,"&gt; could you take insulin to enable you to eat more carbs?

Of course this is the textbook answer, but in reality eating a moderate amount of carbs in a meal isn't as simple as ""just take the correct amount of insulin to cover it and you're all good"".

More carbs = more insulin required = bigger chance of under/over calculating the dose = needing to monitor your BG for the next few hours, make correction doses as needed, etc. It's a lot of hassle and very exhausting. Often I just go for the lower carb option so I don't have to babysit my body and I can just forget about my diabetes for a short time."
sallygeorgia,2022-05-24,2,"Yup, agreed there are downsides. But, could be a solution for someone who is ""reaching their limit"" in their current situation; it may be worth the downsides."
marleymo,2022-05-23,6,Going up 30 points post meal is not bad. Non diabetic people will have their blood sugar go up after eating also. Is it possible you are being too hard on yourself? What do you consider high?
lemoncry_,2022-05-23,2,"If I'm honest, I've been obsessing over that topic these past few weeks. I've been reading a lot how no spike should go over 30 points from baseline so I'm trying to eat according to that. I've found that even complex carbs (say 1/2 rye bread) get me too close to the 30 points spike and it scares me so I end up avoiding a lot of things.

So if my baseline is 87, I try to not go past 117 after 1 hour of eating, I also walk 20 mins after eating in an attempt to not go higher than that."
marleymo,2022-05-23,3,"You should talk to your doctor about what would be a reasonable range for you. I would also mention that you think you might have disordered eating/carb fear/anxiety over this stuff. I think you hit the nail on the head there. 

According to the ADA, prediabetics should aim for 140 2 hours after a meal. I am full blown T2 diabetic but try to keep things under 140 at the peak. If I go over, oh well. Lots of times I'm under and it all averages out. My A1C is in the prediabetic range. This diet and way of eating has to be sustainable long term.  

Do you have a CGM? It might actually make the anxiety worse so I am not sure I would get one. On the plus side, it lets you test out different foods. Some of your favorites might not be as bad as you fear."
lemoncry_,2022-05-23,2,"I've tried mentioning to my doctor but he always just goes like ""you can have complex carbs as long as you have a lot of protein too"" which makes sense but anything more than 1 tablspoon of beans a day makes me real nervous about spikes. 

Saddly I am only able to test with a meter, cgm's arent really available were I live, so I go by finger pricking and since I buy strips myself (not insurance) and they're pricey, I can't test as much as I'd like."
marleymo,2022-05-24,5,"Was your A1C good last time? I think you are being too hard on yourself. The anxiety about what you eat could be more harmful than the pre-diabetes. Is this 30 pt spike information from a reliable source? It sounds extremist or like it's something for people who aren't diabetic at all. I've never heard that.

Beans have a lot of protein and fiber so maybe that fits what your doctor said? Have you tried eating a half cup to see what happens? I know it is still maybe not as much as you want to eat, but it's more than a tablespoon."
lemoncry_,2022-05-24,2,"Last A1C on January was 5.1, but I have yet to check it again.

Its still difficult to me that I can't eat pasta like I used to. Breads/grains have absolutely been the hardest thing to trim down. Oddly enough, sugar was way easier than bread to limit.

I try to focus on things I can have that I know I like. I've taken this as an opportunity to try new things. But there are absolutely days where I want something in a portion I cant have anymore.

I can tell you that it gets easier with time. Also you're not alone."
thebigkayso,2022-05-24,2,"Just wanted to chip in that it might be helpful to keep on testing what you can eat, and in what portion size. I've felt the same way as you, especially having had a long history of orthorexia and going between restricting and binging.  Testing has given me a lot of valuable information about what my body tolerates, which has felt really freeing from my old black and white mindset of all carbs = bad.  It's actually been fun testing different types of food to see what triggers a big glucose spike vs an acceptable one.  I'm not aiming for no spike whatsoever.  I'll test before the meal, and then 1 &amp; 2 hours after the first bite. I generally like to spike less than 40 points and stay under 140 mg/dL overall if possible.  


It seems like everyone's pretty different, so I wouldn't avoid things just because they spike someone else.   
Some interesting things I found were that steel cut oats don't spike me, nor does sourdough bread. Normal white bread does. Brown rice and quinoa, even in small portions, do spike me a fair amount. I can tolerate sugar in small doses also, particularly at the end of a meal that contains a good amount of protein and fiber, as opposed to just on an empty stomach. (This made me really excited because I love cookies, and keto cookies really don't compare) I avoided bananas for a super long time because I assumed they would spike me, but recently I tried a small amount of unripe banana (the riper ones have a higher Glycemic Index) on my peanut butter toast and was super stoked to see minimal impact. 

Just keep in mind that the overall makeup of your meal makes a difference. It's best to eat your carbs with fat, protein and fiber to diminish the blood sugar impact. Food order even matters, apparently (see glucose goddess on instagram for other hacks and scientific studies on this), so eating the carbs last can help.

Good luck!"

MysticMarbles,2022-05-19,3,"Fairly accurate. I generally confirm the sensor on day 1 with a finger stick while stable, and then apply that throughout the sensor. If at the end of day 1 it says 6.4 and I'm at 5.7, I call that close enough and don't worry, because 10% isn't really enough to worry about... no sensor is that accurate all of the time.

They are reportedly pretty horrible in the first 24 hours, but I've never really experienced this (if you scan it'll typically day a wrong number, but the graph evens itself out as it goes, so if you scan and it seems totally out to lunch, sometimes if you wait a minute and scan again it'll be 4-5 points lower or higher, so on day 1 you wanna ignore the actual displayed number and follow the trend on the graph. If the sensor pulls, for example, 12, 7, 11.5, 8, 10.5, 6.4, 11, 6.6, 9.8, 5.4 over 10 minutes, ALL of those numbers are wrong, but the decline from about 9.5 to 7ish will in fact be true which is what the graph will show)

Occasionally I'll have a sensor that reads high by 1 for the entire 2 weeks, but I've never seen one worse than that yet.

Again remember, it's behind by 15 minutes, and a LOT of people complain about that without realizing it is how all CGM's are.

""I got a low alarm saying 4.3 and dropping but I was actually at 3.2 Libre sucks"" is somewhat common around here. Many people seem to not grasp that an interstitial CGM is behind by about a quarter hour, which is why my alarm is set at 4.6 instead of 3.9. If it goes off, I wanna know when I'M going low, not once it's READING low."
monstrinhotron,2022-05-19,2,"They're terrible the first day they're applied, generally pretty good after that but i find they're not very accurate below 4 mmol."
Rockitnonstop,2022-05-19,1,"I find it is pretty accurate. It reads a bit higher (0.5mmol) than my sugars, which I am ok with. WAY more accurate than the libre 1 or dexcom g6 for me."
rainbowthot420,2022-05-20,1,"Personally Ive found that its pretty accurate when my sugars are in a good range, however if theyre a bit high or a bit low the libre will exaggerate it. Like itll show 16/17 but when I check with machine its 13/14 or if its low the libre will read 2.something when the machine will show 3/4."
TaraIsAFox,2022-05-20,1,"I was taught to insert your new sensor within the 24 hours before starting it. Once the old one dies, your new one is already in your arm and ready to go and generally you will get accuracy the first minute to 30 minutes of use! It really works. Just have to insert it hours before the other one dies. Test it out and see if the accuracy improves for you"

I mean, just last couple months I've been woken up out of my sleep for a low 2 or 3 times.  Is that a ""hypoglycemic episode"" and does that mean I'm Disqualified?  I guess I'll have to ask for clarification."
Competitive_Cry2091,2022-04-30,6,"You misunderstood, the unconscious subsentence is the explanation of what they define as relevant symptoms of an episode. If you wake up sweaty or are low during the day and need to eat, this is _not_ what they define a hypo episode."

YupImInARabbitHole,2022-04-30,2,"I personally would not say that's an episode, because you were awakened and aware enough to address it yourself.   The way I read that statement, you would need to be unaware or to have needed help in some way to be medically disqualified.  In other words, it's more than low blood sugar. It's a crisis as a result of low blood sugar. 

But, I think that's a pilot's application.  It's only useful in terms of attempting to understand what they mean by hypo episode.  

It's reasonable to ask for clarification. But, I would be careful about how you ask.  Don't tell them what happened to you, just ask them to give you some examples to help you understand."
Run-And_Gun,2022-04-30,1,"It makes perfect sense and is pretty clear.  They are not saying you cant have had hypo episodes, just that those episodes could not have resulted in you losing consciousness, etc.  You could have been low yesterday and its fine, if you didnt experience loss of consciousness, etc., but if you had a low within the last 12 months and did, you are not eligible(disqualified).

And here is where you have to be honest with yourself, impaired cognitive function&. Ive never passed out from a low, but it is easy enough to experience some brain fog/trouble concentrating for short periods, when you get low sometimes.  Its never been to the point it impaired me, but I dont have a job where if my concentration is broken, I have literally hundreds or thousands of peoples lives in my hands at one time."

Level 2 	Glucose **&lt;54 mg/dL** (3.0 mmol/L).      
Level 3 	A severe event characterized by altered mental and/or physical status **requiring assistance for treatment** of hypoglycemia.     

It's called an *event* when you're at a certain level for at least 15 minutes.

Context is also important. Not being aware of a hypo is considered to be an extra risk factor."

I was at the Paris airport, jetlagged from my 8 hour flight and annoyed that I missed my connecting flight - apparently a very common occurrence in Charles de Gaulle airport - and wanted an empanada from a patisserie. There were two flavors: goat cheese or tuna. The attendant couldn't tell me which was which so I took a chance, bolused up, and ended up biting into a flaky crust filled with tuna.

Ive heard that your stomach can get confused into thinking you have a blockage and cause you to violently purge. That happened to me. 

After you adjust, its no biggie. The only issue I have is that it sends signals to your brain telling you that you are full, but I also get signals saying Im hungry. So I get this weird feeling of being really full and really hungry at the same time."

I was diagnosed a year ago at 215. Within a month I was at 195. After 3-4 months I got to 181, which is my minimum healthy weight. I had to really look for places with enough fat to inject the Ozempic.

Im back up around 195 now, after winter and letting my diet go a little. Im happy under 190. 

So, is it Ozempic or diet or magic? I dont know. But I did lose weight."

BUT I was recently put on Ozempic and my only side effect seems to be low grade nausea. I dont want to increase my dose, but its tolerable. So if the side effects dont resolve for you, it doesnt mean that the whole class of medications will be a problem."

After a year of eating low carb, I see my response and my baseline numbers are pretty good, but it doesnt reverse all the way. So I would tell you, go low carb now. Stop eating potatoes, avoid rice, cut way back on sweets. If you do those things, you will probably see your response improve to the point where you can have them once in a while. 

In short, be strict for a while. Retrain your mind and your body. The end result will be more mild restrictions than if you cross the line into T2."

flaz,2022-05-04,1,"Okay, so you're slim at 95 lbs, typically going to upper 100s after meals, then settling below 120 2 hours post prandial. Glucose tolerance test with 247 after two hours but you never see that number yourself. Also negative for type 1 antibodies.

Not at all suggesting this is what you have, but these symptoms (so far) fit a rare genetic form of diabetes called GCK-MODY which hardly any healthcare professionals know about. I don't see your HbA1c listed here (AKA A1C for short), which is also a pretty important number. An A1C range of about 5.6 to 7.6 would be consistent with GCK-MODY. If you're lucky, that's what you have, because it's not ""pre diabetes"" and requires no treatment. It'll never get worse (simply speaking), unless you contract some other form of diabetes, which is possible but rare. And you won't suffer any damage. More or less, as a GCK-MODY you would simply avoid high carb meals and get your A1C checked annually, otherwise a pretty normal life.

flaz,2022-05-04,1,"Still potential GCK-MODY numbers. Age has nothing to do with it. In fact, the acronym for MODY, Mature Onset Diabetes of the Youth, is a horrible acronym because it is highly misleading. Since it is genetic, the condition occurs at conception and never goes away. It is speculated that most live their entire lives never knowing they had it because their pancreas never fails, it just doesn't produce insulin in low range. They clued into my wife's ""diabetes"" when she went to get birth control pills one time and they said her fasting sugars were too high and needed to see a doctor. She was first diagnosed as type 2, then later upgraded to type 1 after child number three when the numbers didn't come back down after delivery. Many years later, after three children, her endo finally figured out that something wasn't right. Our whole lives have been flipped upside down two or three times because of this GCK-MODY thing and the lack of widespread knowledge in the profession about it. Now she doesn't take insulin at all (yes, on her doctor's orders). The lack of widespread knowledge of it is why I'm here, to hopefully catch a few who might possibly also have it."
Ok_Lack6508,2022-05-04,1,"I understand. I will certainly bring it up to my endo. Though my fasting has never been high. I'm consistently in 70's &amp; 80's for fasting, rarely low 90's."
flaz,2022-05-04,1,"Those are great fasting numbers. Are you taking any medication for hyperglycemia, such as Metformin?

WoefulHC,2022-05-17,6,"In short, NO.  

Slightly longer version, even with high metabolic levels while eating 0 carbs the body NEEDS insulin. 

Complete lack of insulin tends to be fatal pretty quickly. Much more quickly than it is possible to starve to death. For people with healthy insulin metabolisms (that is they are not diabetic) ketosis poses a much lower risk than it does for those of us with diabetes. 

Another [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/urtxpp/reminder_diabetic_ketoacidosis_dka_is_not_caused/) in this sub has good, accurate information on ketosis versus DKA. Ketosis can be healthy and it typically required for weight loss. DKA means the body is dying. It is more involved than just ""high blood sugar combined with ketones in the blood"". The high blood sugar isn't even requirement."
East-Tumbleweed,2022-05-17,11,"Yes the keyones are the same but they're occurring for different reasons. 

With the ketogenic diet, you are starving your body of glucose, so it starts to use ketones in stead of glucose in your mitochondria. It doesn't usually become excessive, because you still take insulin for the protein and small amounts of carbs you're eating, and your body is using dietary fat for ketone production. You will release some ketones in your urine, but still healthy amounts if you're doing it right. It's worth noting that ketones in your urine are a byproduct rather than an issue in themselves. 

When you don't have insulin, and you aren't using fat as your energy source, your body starts breaking down its own fat in order to fuel your mitochondria. The only problem is, you still have high BG, so your body is in a state of panic, breaking down fat within the body. The ketones grow exponentially, spiking your blood ph balance to dangerous levels (ketoacidosis). Eventually, your body even starts to steal fat and protein from your organs to survive. In this state, you spill way more ketones than in ketosis (again, the spillage is just a byproduct, not the issue itself)

The key here is dietary fat being transformed into ketones for use in mitochondria, vs. Bodily fat due to the body's attempt to survive. If you're eating enough fat and below a certain percentage of carbohydrates to put you in ketosis, this can be healthy and safe."
AeroNoob333,2022-05-17,6,"All this! This is why diabetics (especially in T1/insulin deficient) lose a lot of weight without trying and its one of the signs. Its also worth noting that there is actually an eating disorder in some diabetics called diabulemia, where individuals will purposely take less insulin and purposely keep their bgs high in order to lose weight easily. This is a dangerous and unhealthy way to lose weight."
East-Tumbleweed,2022-05-17,1,"Did you read my conclusion? This wasn't about losing weight, it was about managing diabetes through fat consumption in stead of carb consumption as a source of energy. If you eat enough fat and protein, this can be safe and helps to manage blood glucose levels since there is less margin for error in bolus calculations from lower carbohydrates.

I am a think guy and have been able to gain weight on keto. I lost 30 lbs in dka 4 weeks ago and have gained back 20 already (partially from carbs initially, and partially from keto in the past 2 weeks. 

Still, for anyone interested, it's worth watching this [lecture](https://youtu.be/GzPcLI17FzI)

Be sure to consult with your doctor and maybe show them this if you suspect they are unaware of the benefits and possibilities."

MizchiefKilz,2022-05-17,1,"Makes sense, I'm trying to figure out if ""Keto"" is really good for diabetics, or would the diet for us be slightly different. I think ""low carb"" make sense but Keto seems a bit extreme to me for a long-term diet."
East-Tumbleweed,2022-05-17,4,Keto is a lot easier today than it used to be as well. It might be worth giving a couple of meals a try at home and at restaurants. There are even keto ice creams and loads of sugar free treats which I'm sure you're aware of as a diabetic. It's not too tough an adjustment.
East-Tumbleweed,2022-05-17,1,"I think the challenge with low carb is you are teetering on the edge of keto, so you aren't getting enough energy and you'll constantly have keto flu (you can look that one up)."
mystisai,2022-05-17,2,"Ketoacidosis is when the ketones become too much and it turns the blood acidic.

Its basically a threshold that gets crossed.

Under that threshold you are okay, but over it and bad things are going to start to happen.

Being in ketosis doesn't mean it's inevitable that you will be in ketoacidosis. Its about moderation.

Diabetic Ketoacidosis happens due to insulin.

Other forms of Ketoacidosis include Starvation Ketoacidosis and Alcohol Ketoacidosis."
vastmagick,2022-05-17,1,"&gt;Are these ketones the same as the ones in the keto diet?

Yes, and they are the same ketones of any weight loss diet.  When your body burns fat it produces ketones.  Ketones are acidic and too much can turn your blood too acidic for your internal organs to handle.

The keto diet can be dangerous but not because of the ketones (at least for nondiabetics).  Our body can't produce insulin to break down proteins for energy like normal people.  The elevated ketones in a diabetic body can make diagnosing DKA harder.  And this is all in addition to the higher cholesterol, kidney damage and heart risks associated with this diet(the diet doesn't cause these issues, these issues are correlated to this type of diet I want to be clear on that)."
Accomplished-Job2627,2022-05-17,1,"A ketogenic diet is really in the range of low to very low carbs. Since you still need energy, that can be supplied by eating high fat OR protien.  There are a few steps along the way. Eliminating carbs does result in a change in the body to use keytones rather than glucose for fuel. This is becoming fat adapted or using fat for energy. So, cells can be powered by keytones when there is no glucose. For the body to get to an efficient use of keytones takes some time.  Keytones in urine are the ones the body couldn't use so they are eliminated. Now to DKA....DKA doesn't happen in the presence if insulin. So for therapeutic ketosis, that level might run up to around 5mmol. DkA acidification would drive keytones up to the 15+range. So you can see the difference. And thus a major concern if you do not produce insulin but rarely an issue for the t2 person.

I am t2 with no insulin or meds now. Keytones are my friend and I strive for zero carbs and works great. Even w/ t1 the condition can be bettered (dr bernsteins diabetes diet).

Eating fat will not make you fat. Saturated fat is not assiciated with cvd. Dietary cholesterol dies not drive high cholesterol  at all. Your liver produces about 85% of your cholesterol."
[deleted],2022-05-17,-1,[deleted]
MarcusForrest,2022-05-17,4,"&gt; The risk for DKA is from hyperglycemia and no insulin.

**Very important correction:**

DKA isn't caused by Hyperglycemia but caused by insulin insufficiency. Hyperglycemia is just **another** consequence of insulin insufficiency but it isn't what **causes** DKA - insulin insufficiency is the cause. 

&amp;nbsp;

Euglycemic DKA is a thing too _(DKA while **not** in hyperglycemia)_

&amp;nbsp;

I've been in non-hyper DKA before, barely over 9.0 mmol/L  _(162 mg/dL)_ due to insulin insufficiency, that isn't quite Hyperglycemia, but I was running low on insulin at the time and I was on the pump - it only takes a few hours to get into DKA when you're not using basal insulin."
[deleted],2022-05-17,-2,[deleted]
MarcusForrest,2022-05-17,1,"&gt; Again not disputing anything you said, but you're misconstruing what I said regarding DKA.

You're right, I really misinterpreted your comment, my bad!

I read _'' is from hyperglycemia and **not** insulin.''_ rather than appropriately read _'' is from hyperglycemia and **no** insulin.''_"
LeMansDynasty,2022-05-18,14,"Got diagnosed at 28 years old. It gave me the drive to become a triathlete. 

Don't 

1. Talk about stupid non cures like cleanses, cinnamon, etc. 

2. Say at least you got pizza/cake/soda when you were young!


Do

1. Offer to help with meal prep or take a cooking class with your SO. I reccomend Asian style stir fry recipes. Lots of veggies, spices and meat.

2. Listen to their rants/venting. 

3. Offer to join them in a new cardio hobby. Mountain biking, masters swim courses at you local pool, your local road runners club, free diving courses, dance lessons.

4. Encourage them to get a continuous glucose monitor CGM. It is 100 times better than finger stabbing. If you endocrinologist won't write you the script now find another endo.

Don't just sign them up for any of the above or buy a bunch of stuff with out your SO on board first. He/she is already feeling a giant loss of control over life, do not exacerbate it by trying to take over.

If you are planning on having children look at cord blood storage. Most current cures in clinical trials work around stem cells. You can get stem cell treatments for type 1 in Canada, Japan and Panama. If you have the financial means look in to it. If not store your baby's umbilical cord blood (with a professional service) for later use.

If your SO gets in to a cardio hobby I highly reccomend 

1. Finding a work out group. Roadrunner, Masters swim, your local bike shop are great places to look. You won't find more supportive positive groups.

2. Enroll in a contest triathlon, 5k, 10k, aqua bike, etc. Gives you something to train for.

3. Set rewards. Generally buying a nice new piece of gear or a trip or what ever fir hitting A1C or training marks."

Majestic-Vehicle8547,2022-05-18,5,"My wife was diagnosed with late onset type 1 as an adult two years ago. My biggest piece of advice for someone in your situation is to really understand your SOs condition (what type 1 diabetes really is) and to be someone who your SO can turn to as the person who actually understands their struggle and what they are going through. Dealing with this for the last two years, the most striking thing for us is how little people really understand about type 1, even after it being explained to them. If you take the time to understand what your partner is going through, it will make a world of difference in being able to support them."

You can live a perfectly normal life in fact in some respects better than someone without type one. These days management is far easier especially with a cgm, pump and  the modern insulin these days. Diet modifications can also help. She can turn this into something that will better her life but right now just being their is amazing for you . To listen, to hug your so, and love them! She will start feeling better . This is not a death sentence

DJ_Earthworm,2022-05-18,3,"As someone who is also late onset type 1, I went through a lot of what did I do wrong questions. Ultimately I had to accept it wasnt me as much as my body.   As an SO my guess is that your best approach is to be supportive and encouraging.  Its a massive shock to both of you, but its a bump in the road and once the overwhelming part is behind you, it just becomes part of life.  We still do everything we did before, it just takes a little planning depending on what your doing.  Travel?  No problem. Dining out? No problem. Meeting friends for parties?  No problem.  I have a very active lifestyle professionally and personally, and it hasnt slowed me down or gotten in the way. 

The most difficult for both of you will be mentally.  Early on I was VERY frustrated and disappointed.  Many days I wanted to just ignore it and my SO would become disappointed in me. I didnt want to disappoint her, so I kept going.  Eventually I realized it wasnt so bad, and it just clicked.  

Long story short : Its here, not a dream, talk about it as fact, dont dance around it, and be overly supportive.  I also suggest taking any and all coaching / courses the hospital has to offer. Those courses were game changers for us. 

Good luck!  You both got this."
AlexLeeDunn,2022-05-18,3,"As much as it is a self managed condition, be there for them when it becomes too overwhelming for one person. Learn with them on what to eat, how to dose insulin, how to make corrections, etc. Some days it is just enough and having someone else to walk through the steps would help. Understand there will be restrictions on certain things. More thought goes into taking trips or even going the grocery store. If you are both eat the same it will keep them from feeling as left out but don't tell them they can't have something because sometimes you just need a cookie."
sunny_thinks,2022-05-18,2,"I was dxd 9 months ago at 30 years old. Ill never forget the shock of it: I have no family history of T1 and was training for a 10k and went to the doctor for routine blood work. Came out with an insulin pen and a T1 dx. I remember crying at the doctors office and then crying when I called my husband after I left the doctor. I felt so horrible and broken. And I remember him telling me Well get through this, I love you. He turned up at home later with a bunch of sugar-free snacks and a bunch of random stuff. His attitude was basically, How can I support you as you navigate this? and in that spirit hes watched me learn to take insulin, gone w/me to doctors appointments, sat through my crying fits, eats my glucose tablets (lol) and really just was and is so supportive. I wouldnt have been able to get through this dx without him.  
  
And so Id say, learn about what T1 is, and be there for your partner as best as you can. Some days will be easy, and some days are really, really hard. But it makes such a world of difference when your partner has your back! Feel free to reach out via DM if you want to chat."

4thshift,2022-05-18,2,"I wish theyd stop claiming there is such a thing as late onset. Most new diagnosis are adults and stats from UK indicate equivalent frequency of incidences occur in under 18s as they do in over 30s. You get autoimmunity when you get autoimmunity; accept it and move on beyond the whys and hows   theres no good pattern of it in most people. Nobody has any explanation to give you, and it can happen at virtually any age. If there were.any pattern at all to it, there might be a clue as to what the causes are. But nobody does, nobody. And you see here many people are late onset which automatically negates the term if so many people get it as adults  in actuality, the majority. 

As far as taking care of your girlfriend / boyfriend / significant other (going with female pronouns here). Ask her what she wants you to do about it. She has it forever, and will need insulin injected or infused forever. Taking care of it is an inexact science, and learning how to deal with it is kind of lonely journey, because unless you have the same thing, you cannot ever understand what it is like to constantly check, constantly prepare, constantly make choices about food and its glucose effects. But, since you are nice and caring, you can read up about insulins, and different kinds of glucose monitors, and metabolism and food macronutrients. You can also understand what DKA is and hypoglycemia, so you can identify any potential serious problems, and know what to do in case they happen. If she is in a mood or feeling off, that is going to happen with diabetes (in addition to any other normal reason).  As a caring boyfriend, you have to find a balance between being helpful and letting her find her way. Thats true for all relationships, but with diabetes, it is daily stress on her to get it right or else you are gonna suffer. So, nice of you to ask. You should be talking to her about it, and she should open up to you about it as you are in a relationship  but nobody is perfect."

lcdawg11,2022-05-19,1,"The fact that you're asking this question at all tells me you'll be ok. It is hard to navigate for sure, for both of you. I was diagnosed about 14 months ago. I have been through 3 endos and a ton of frustration. I figured out a low carb, high fat diet worked better for me and also realized that my body was still producing some insulin on its own, so I got to the point where I didn't have to take it any more. Still have to monitor my blood sugar because eventually that will not be the case. If they're in the hospital that may not be an option.

The top response talks about picking up a cardio routine and any exercise will be good, but I've learned through my personal experience that weight lifting has been a better way to manage it than cardio. I ran a marathon a year after diagnosis, so I'm not pulling this out of nowhere. Either way, if it's something they enjoy and want to continue doing that's probably your best option.

Be patient, the learning curve is really steep and the stakes are super high. It's like being handed a newborn when you didn't know one was coming. You're going to see them get frustrated with their blood sugar level or just the fact that they have to pause what they're doing to check. This is normal, allow them the time they need. One thing that always helped me was the saying (2+2 is not always 4). It is really accurate when it comes to diabetes care. Let them learn the disease and be supportive, and eventually you wont have to constantly worry about them.

Rockitnonstop,2022-05-15,2,Any chance youd like to share the peanut butter chia cookie recipe? Sounds awesome!
lemoncry_,2022-05-16,2,"Super quick and easy!

- 1 cup of peanut butter or almond butter
- Pinch of salt (if nut butter is already salted, don't add it)
- Chia seeds (i can't give you exact measurements, explained below)
- 1/8 cup of granulated sweetener, add less or more depending how sweet you like them (I used monk fruit)

So, add nut butter into a large bowl, then sweetener, mix well. Add pinch of salt if necessary. Then little by little go adding 1 tablespoon of chia seeds at a time, mix each time. The amount you'll need will depend on how runny the nut butter is; the consistency should be almost firm- not runny or too sticky. When you get that texture, wet your hands slightly and make little balls of your mixture then push them into a baking sheet like little disks. My batch made about 8 medium cookies. 

Finally, bake for about 5 min, always check on them as they can burn quickly. When done, get them out of the oven and let them cool completely.

Note these cookies are very crumbly and crunchy, but i personally don't mind it!"

DogKnowsBest,2022-04-30,3,"57M here. 6ft, 145lbs. Diagnosed at 54 weighting 165. Probably was diabetic a year or two before diagnosed.  My fasting blood sugar was 285 and A1C was 14.1.  My cholesterol was out of whack, blood pressure was borderline high.  Doc took one look at my blood test numbers and asked me if I had ever had a heart attack or a stroke.  Nope to both.  He told me he was amazed I was sitting in his office...

 Doc put me on Metformin and Jardiance; both 1 a day oral meds for the diabetes. He put me on Lisinopril and Rosuvastatin to combat the rest.  I cut a lot of unnecessary carbs and started exercising 30 mins a day.  Within 6 months my fasting blood sugar was 105 and my A1C was 6.7.  I'm now off the Metformin completely and take 1 Glipizide and 1 Jardiance a day.  I have completely modified and adjusted to my new low carb diet and maintain an A1C between 6.3 and 6.9.  Cholesterol and BP are perfect.

Because of this diagnosis, and the resulting changes I made to get my blood sugar levels under control, I'm in the best shape of my life.  I loosely follow KETO. I learned what foods triggered my spikes the most and limit those.   I can honestly say that other than missing out of a lot of the massive sugar binges I used to enjoy, I live a completely normal life. I have to watch what I eat and I do miss a few things, but after all the adjustments, I have a new normal and I'm good with it.  I eat normally (just less carbs).  My weight is down to 145lbs.

I think you can live a perfectly normal life. The medications available to you today are the best they have ever been.  Do what you need to bring down your blood sugar levels and your A1C. Make that a part of your daily regime.  It's entirely possible to live a very long and fulfilling life."
PresentElk9115,2022-04-30,1,"Thanks man for writing this, that was the only thing I'm afraid of dying at 35 or 4o due to this, but with each passing hour I'm trying to look at the bright side, maybe I can get through this"
DogKnowsBest,2022-04-30,3,"So, here's the thing; and it's how I view this.  There is currently no cure for diabetes.  There are very effective treatments for most people, but you'll always be a diabetic.  Knowing that, OWN it.  Don't let it consume you.  It's a part of you, but you can do things to manage it.

Learn. Read it about. Learn the difference between glycemic index and glycemic load.  Learn that it's not about how much sugar, but how much carbs.  When people say ""you can't have sugar"", I say ""sure I can... in measured, limited quantities"".  I have a certain number of carbs I try to stay under a day... it doesn't matter if they are all sugar or something else..  As far as the typical T2 diabetic is concerned, it doesn't matter if that carb comes from a candy bar or a starchy vegetable.  \*There may be other reasons it matters, but not because I'm diabetic.

Exercise. If you don't exercise now, start.  If you exercise 30 mins a day, bump it to 60 mins a day.  Find low carb alternatives to things you like.  I gotta say that Adkins makes a chocolate covered peanut caramel nougat bar much like a Baby Ruth that only has 3 grams net carbs. BOOM. I haven't had a sugary soda in over 30 years; but I love my Coke Zero and Diet Mountain Dew.  

Just make modifications; slowly over time.  Instead of depriving yourself to the point that you have uncontrollable binges, just slowly modify with substitutions.  It can be done because I was the pickiest of eaters and LOVED my sweets.  I still have them occasionally, but far less frequently and much smaller servings.

Lastly, always know that new treatments, drugs, and potential cures are always right around the corner.  The future is bright and there's no reason you can't be the same YOU as you have always been, but maybe a healthier version like I became.

Good luck."
NarrowForce9,2022-04-30,1,This is good advice.
indiealexh,2022-04-30,3,"Depending on a number of factors, depends on your treatment options.

But the basic thing every diabetic should do, eat smaller meals more frequently. Eat healthy. Avoid high sugar foods when you can and the more complex the carb the better.

Things to talk to your doctor about:

1) referral to a dietitian (they can help you work out if and what you need to change in your diet)
2) see if medications like Trulicity or other GPT1 antagonists might help you, when they work, they are like magic
3) scheduling regular eye exams and podiatry appointments"
Accomplished-Job2627,2022-05-01,4,"As a t2d, this is not the way. Start by getting a handle on carbs, simple and complex. Reduce them. Starches are trouble and that is certainly most veg which grow below tge ground. Do not eat lots of small meals. This causes insulin to stay high and remain high. Your body needs time without food to downrrgulate insulin. High insulin also drives cvd.  This doesn't have to be scary.

mystisai,2022-04-29,7,"&gt;Are there times when you had planned a meal, didn't have enough insulin doses to cover it, and needed to adjust the meal to have the right number of carbs? 

Not once ever. I am the type of individual who will go high and just adjust insulin when I get home.

But the people in math problems don't exist in the real world. Little Johnny does not have 23 oranges after eating 12, and giving Betty 9."
YesterdayOld6653,2022-04-29,1,"Totally understand, would you say that it's more common to make insulin adjustments after the meal as opposed to changing the meal to fit the insulin units?  Maybe I could write the activity to follow that instead"
mystisai,2022-04-29,3,"It really depends on the individual. 

Some people have to bolus 15 minutes or more before they eat. This ensures the insulin is working as the food is being absorbed. They have issues if they prebolus and then can't get their meal on time, or if they bolus for more food than received.

I have food absorption problems caused by diabetic neuropathy. If I prebolus, I will go low while I am eating, the insulin is absorbed faster. If I have a fat and protein heavy meal, I take my insulin after I finish eating since fats and proteins also slow carb absorption."
cheech-wizard,2022-04-29,4,"I dont know the age level you are teaching.

My take on this would be to not focus on numbers.  More along the line of  Mary ate a salad. Will she need more or less insulin than if she ate french fries and a hamburger?  Why?

Demonstrating the difference between consuming non/low carbohydrate foods and high carbohydrate foods and their resultant impact on blood glucose, and the insulin dosage needed to correct."
YesterdayOld6653,2022-04-29,0,"We are designing this for middle school students, ideally, grade 7.  We were hoping to keep things on the numbers side to prevent issues with students bullying each other for their food selections.

I was hoping to expose them to some simple algebra with equations like:  
CHO Insulin dose=Total carbohydrates (g) x Insulin:CHO Ratio  
High blood sugar correction dose = (Difference between actual blood sugar and target blood sugar) ÷ correction factor  
I got these equations and scenarios [here](https://dtc.ucsf.edu/types-of-diabetes/type1/treatment-of-type-1-diabetes/medications-and-therapies/type-1-insulin-therapy/calculating-insulin-dose/)

The scenario I have written now has a diabetic student trying to buy lunch at a food court.  The student has a certain amount of money they are allowed to spend and the students have to pick items that fit the budget.  Then students would count up the carbs in the meal they'd like to eat and see how many insulin units would be needed to accompany the meal.  Our follow-up is that the diabetic student realizes they don't have enough insulin units for the desired meal so the students would need to calculate the total carbs that would be covered with the insulin on hand and re-pick their meal to fit that restriction.

I'm just hoping to figure out if that's a realistic situation that someone might find themselves in."
drugihparrukava,2022-04-29,3,"I'll try to answer at length later but just a heads up, there are over 42 known factors that influence our insulin dosage calculators. And every T1 will be different in this regard. Everyone will have a different i:c ratio, some of us bolus for protein and have a different equation for that, and so much more :) Example: I bolused for black coffee this morning but needed to factor in only 4 hours of sleep, illness, and feet on floor syndrome plus expected work stress and changes in my monthly cycle. It's fun math."
younghannahg,2022-04-30,2,"If there was a time that I planned a meal and didn't have enough insulin dose to cover it that is more of a problem with insurance. A container of insulin - or a pen like I use - have three hundred units of insulin. If you do not have enough insulin in one pen, I always have a second one in my bag. I guess I'm not saying it couldn't happen, but it doesn't happen a lot. 

Ideally you teach about what you eat isn't the problem. Insulin isn't the problem. You have to give yourself for both French fries and salad. Explain that using more insulin isn't a bad thing, it is just what you have to do to survive.  French fries aren't really ""healthy"" but kids know that. You could also just do something healthier like whole wheat bread.  But you definitely do not have too. 

I understand what you are doing. When it comes down to it, math problems are unrealistic most of the time. It is just what they are to make a good math problem. I think your idea will create a discussion, which is great!"
vastmagick,2022-04-29,2,"&gt;I'm just hoping to figure out if that's a realistic situation that someone might find themselves in.

That is a very simplified situation that someone might find themselves in.  Does it happen?  Yeah.  

My only fear with a scenario like this would be that it makes diabetes seem simple to control.  Just do the math and everything is fine.  The sad fact is that the math is far more complicated than I think your average 7th grader will want to learn.  Some of that is from the fact that our blood sugar reading is not 100% accurate, part of it is that there are over 42 factors that control blood sugar, and part of it is that nutritional facts are allowed to be 20% off from what is actually in the food.  

What this means is that if you have your class do this scenario and everyone got the same answer, some of them would actually be right and some of them would be wrong and that is a frustrating lesson to learn, but that is what we live with."
Renvors,2022-04-29,2,What kind of students are you trying to teach? Because this could go a lot of ways. Is this elementary school kids? High school biology? NNursing students or other university students?

mystisai,2022-04-29,2,"But what is the end goal, complex math problems or a better understanding of diabetes?

If it's the latter, it depends on so many factors. 

Some people have to bolus for fats and proteins too. Some people have an extended honeymoon period and do not follow those formulas.

Some people are on glargine insulins and some people are on isophanes, some are on rapid acting in a pump. Making some need to eat an exact amount of carbs at more regular intervals, or others a more minute amounts of insulin into the .05 of a unit."
YesterdayOld6653,2022-04-29,1,"I guess I have two goals for this activity: (1) to understand some of the considerations someone with diabetes will have to make before eating and (2) for them to practice some of their basic algebra skills.

I want the scenario to be realistic but realize there are a lot complexities and factors at play that are different for each person.  Below is the situation I had started with:

A diabetic student is trying to buy lunch at a food court. The student has a certain amount of money they are allowed to spend and the students working on the assignment have to pick items that fit the budget. Then students would count up the carbs in the meal they'd like to eat and see how many insulin units would be needed to accompany the meal. Our follow-up is that the diabetic student realizes they don't have enough insulin units for the desired meal so the students would need to calculate the total carbs that would be covered with the insulin on hand and re-pick their meal to fit that restriction.

I guess one thing to note about this scenario is that it will definitely be on the simpler side of things by only accounting for carbs and not lipids or proteins.  And I suppose that this also assumes that the person needs to bolus very shortly before they eat, hence the need to recalculate to for the insulin on hand.

Is this a realistic scenario?"
mystisai,2022-04-29,2,"I would say yes, that it is realistic enough to get the point across. Like little Johnny and his 23 oranges.   


It's not stepping on toes or being uncouth."
AmericanGirl1493,2022-04-29,2,"If the goal of the lesson is to give students a look into what it's like to live with Type 1 Diabetes, introducing algebra equations isn't really helpful as no one living with diabetes actually calculates like that in the real world. 

In general there are SO many nuances and complexities that goes into giving insulin to cover food that it's virtually impossible to standardize, so I guess I don't understand how this would be graded or even discussed. I guess you could do something simple like ""if sally has a sandwich and apple for lunch, how many units of insulin would she need to cover the meal?"" Again though that isn't really giving an accurate picture of what it's like to live with diabetes because it doesn't capture the complexities of insulin and food intake or reflect that even if you do the math perfectly, there's still a chance that you go high or low after.

I think something you could focus on instead is just how many decisions a person with T1D needs to make every day starting from the minute you wake up to going to bed (and through the night sometimes!). There's a lot of value in showing how much effort and brain space it takes to live with this disease."
igotzthesugah,2022-04-29,2,I try to plan ahead and shoot for what Im going to eat but serving sizes and unknown ingredients foul up that math so I shoot more afterwards if needed.  I dont think Id ever eat less or alter my meal plan.  I like to eat.  T1 has turned it into enough of a pain in the ass already.
Rockitnonstop,2022-04-29,2,"You could make a great trick question by asking students to calculate the carb., protien and fat in a meal and give a dose. Most likely they would only dose for carbs. They would be wrong for a lot of diabetic. Protien and fat also need their own ratios or a staggered approach. So you could ask what they thought the dose AND timing would be. 

Things that I consider in a meal are prebolusing time for carbs, correction dose for what was actually eaten, check in sugars 2 hours later to see if I need to correct the dose due to fat and protein. 

This is a really handy reference for the math involved https://www.diabeteseducatorscalgary.ca/medications/insulin/insulin-for-protein-and-fat.html"
KokoPuff12,2022-04-30,2,"If you want to have them re-calculate, I'd do something along the lines of ""the food they selected was not available or did not come out as planned"" instead of ""they realized they did not have enough insulin on hand.""  When I was doing manual injections, I changed my insulin once a month.  Often a T1d doesn't go through a lot and our pens/vials don't unexpectedly run out often.  Sure, it's possible, but not very common.  What's more common is ""I didn't bring insulin with me at all"" but that doesn't make for a switch in math.  Another thing that can be common would be to look at the menu in advance and do the math, but then to arrive and said restaurant is closed or doesn't have the item you had chosen to eat.  


Another thing that could change the equation is that Billy's blood glucose shifted from the time of deciding to the time of dosing.  Maybe the morning's activities were different than usual, resulting in a low from the activity.  Or, maybe the adrenaline of arriving at the Food Court caused a spike.  Now, for those who include their current blood glucose to get to a dosage, the math has changed.  


And, if you'd like different math to work with, this is how I calculate my dose.  I do eat a pretty good balance of fat and protein with my carbs.  So, I convert those into carbs and dose for those, as well.  https://waltzingthedragon.ca/diabetes/nutrition-excercise/reduce-post-meal-spikes-caused-by-fat-and-protein/"

bionic_human,2022-05-14,1,"Okay, that's not one of the newer ones.

If it were me, I would probably give a little extra bolus towards the end of the night if eating. If not eating, a unit or two every couple of hours of fast-acting to hold myself over and then give the full lantus dose immediately upon getting home. If I were worried about dose overlap, I'd do the next night's at 11:30 or so, and the one after that back at 10:30 to get back on track. If not worried about overlapping doses, I'd just go straight back to 10:30 tomorrow night.

Lantus is known to be iffy about lasting a full 24 hours anyway (it never did for me, which is why I'm on a pump), so I probably wouldn't worry about overlapping the doses too much."
leyniaz,2022-05-14,3,"Yeah I would do this too. Keep an eye on your sugars between 10:30-12 and if you need a little extra fast acting for food or a slight high, then do that. Take the full dose when home.

MysticMarbles,2022-05-14,17,The best all around diet for Diabetes is whatever diet works for YOUR diabetes.
CosmicSmackdown,2022-05-14,3,You might try a modified lower carb way of eating. The Mediterranean diet works well for me. I also eat gluten free so I modify it to fit what I need.
BarnacledBrain,2022-05-14,1,Yeah I'll check the Mediterranean diet out it sounds like what I'm looking for.
Rockitnonstop,2022-05-14,2,"Id say the best thing you can do is to learn to cook for yourself. It helps to limit unnecessary fat, sodium or carbs depending on what you cook. Everyone has a different flavour profile, so whatever you like to eat, try to cook the healthy version of that. Lots of veggies (LOTS) and high protein meat/dairy diet works for me, with fruit and things like granola subbed in when I need a good bump in sugars. 

Exercise is another important part of cardiovascular health, so think about getting at least a half hour (ideally more) of moderate activity a day. I love exercise, partially because it lets me eat more carbs, and also because it gets me out of the house. I bike 3 hours a day and lift for an hour, it has kept a lot of circulatory and nerve issues away and helped with my retinopathy by keeping my sugars more stable. 

It might be worthwhile to look up a few diabetic friendly diets (Mediterranean, low carb, plant based) and see what you like and what works well with your own body. Give it time, a few weeks, and then see if it is worth pursuing long term. Again, this is where cooking for yourself becomes fun, you may try a diet and it not work, but gain a recipe that you like out of it to incorporate with other meals you do."
BarnacledBrain,2022-05-14,1,"I do need to start cooking more.  I already lift weights as I am trying to get into powerlifting, part of why I've justified eating 3 double quarter pounders at McDonald's lol.  I do not cook enough, youre right it sounds like that could really work."

sarahspins,2022-05-18,4,"I had a BRVO some years ago and mine was determined not to be related to diabetes. I didnt know it at the time (found out shortly after when I did 23andMe) but I have a genetic thrombophilia and that was more likely a contributor than my then 15 years of T1 were. 

Mine actually resolved without intervention, but was constantly monitored (weekly) watching for any new vessel formation that would have been problematic. I do have a slight distortion in that area of my vision, but its not anywhere near my central vision and doesnt bother me any more - its kind of the equivalent of a scar. My vision did fully return, and there are no blind spots or anything, its more that I can tell exactly where the effected area was. 

My BRVO did not cause bleeding or anything else (in fact, I am confused by that as your description - a BRVO is usually caused by a blockage in one of the veins in the retina, they do not normally bleed, that would be more like retinopathy) - I just had an immediate loss of vision in that area, and saw an eye doctor the same day, who got me into the retina specialist the following day."
logicalinsanity,2022-05-18,1,"Thanks for your insight. Thats a good point on the bleeding. The ""hemmorage"" term was given to me by the regular optometrist, but the retinal specialist gave the BRVO diagnosis and mentioned swelling of the nerves was more of the cause? Idk kind of unclear. I can ask for clarity as I'll be back in 2 weeks to start injections that I gues should bring the swelling down. The blockage in one of the veins in the retina is definitely what they're saying is the the true cause though, but on the vein that is supposed to take blood out.

I think they put in for a test for thrombophilia, but weirdly i don't think I've ever had a genetic predisposition for that? My first thought went to covid = hasn't there been rare cases of that leading to long term issues with clotting?"

I'm very on top of monitoring even though my last 3 A1C tests have been good and will definitely take action quickly if I see any changes."

logicalinsanity,2022-05-19,1,Thats a good point. At the advice of this sub I asked about seeing an endo and my primary was kinda against it because I didn't seem to need the additional help? That was kinda weird.
Leeanth,2022-05-19,1,Always see an endo for diabetes. Type one or two. See the best you can.
AgingMinotaur,2022-05-19,2,"Very sorry to hear that. Keep in mind, you may have gone for a long while undiagnosed and that may have caused damage, or factors outside the diabetes may have played a role. In any case, good bg control will absolutely provide protection in the future. Judging by your a1c numbers, you seem to be handling the disease very well."
logicalinsanity,2022-05-19,1,Thank you kind internet stranger. Very good points.

pheregas,2022-05-23,1,"With Dexcom, there is no programming. It just does its thing.  The only time it actually uses your presets is if the cgm stops.

Are you sure your insulin correction ratio is ok? That is hard wired."
OrangElm,2022-05-22,2,Easier if you start at a solid weight and want to add muscle/get in better cardio shape because the extra carbs/calories wont impact that much. I see how it would be extremely hard to lose weight though.

PhoenixHeart86,2022-05-22,2,"I am sorry, wasn't meant to dredge anything up!

It's hard! Was hard for them when we were young, is hard for us as we get older and will likely be hard for our kids as we get older still. We can do all we can to make it easier on everyone else and that's one of the few reasons I have left to give a sh*t.

But it isn't your fault, you didn't choose this, no sane person would. If you are living in the states or a country with poor health care it would have been harder still but not your fault. Fact you are here means they did a good job and you still are or at least trying.

Don't blame yourself, blame this sh*tty condition and all the factors around it but not yourself. I'm sure there were other factors anyway but not my place to assume just want you to know it's not on you!"

plumbusc136,2022-05-21,48,Have a nice bowl of rice.
Hot_Blackberry_6895,2022-05-21,20,My recently diagnosed Japanese wife agrees. It is so hard for her. She used to eat rice three times a day for her whole life. She is really suffering at the moment with the required dietary changes. A small bowl of half white/half brown rice a day is thin gruel for her. Diabetes sucks.
HollingB,2022-05-22,8,I have thought a lot about people who are so used to eating a lot of rice. Thai food in particular really messes me up. Its so much easier to low carb American food. =A

greatbigcornhole,2022-05-22,9,"why dont you guys eat rice? hard to predict the carbs? Ive never had many issues, so Im just curious your reasoning!"
plumbusc136,2022-05-22,15,"Im type 2 so insulin tends not to help much when my pancreas is already producing high amount of insulin. Its the insulin receptors thats broken. So, food like rice which is rich in carb and highly processed can spike blood glucose in a very short amount of time and given the insulin resistance nature of type 2, its hard to bring that number down."

But one thing that Ive learned from this experience is the value of having a healthy and yet sustainable diet. I honestly dont think Ill ever change my eating habits again, because while it is nice to have the freedom to eat whatever I want, it is also nice to eat not so tasty but healthy foods just because of how much better I feel about during the day.

I do think that once the situation is more under control Ill start allowing me some cheat days every now and then, but I would never go back to my old eating habits because honestly after a while junk food stops being so delicious when you eat it too often and switching from eating junk food almost every day to having a balanced and healthy diet is just so much harder than just maintaining a healthy diet once you get used to it."

[deleted],2022-04-29,68,"Ding ding ding youre the winner if you check OPs other comments. Ive had this happen with a few patients I had who did something similar. Always wash before a manual POC glucose.

Also the go to the ER advice all over this thread isnt great either. Unless youre in DKA an ER trip is just going to end up with you sitting there for hours while nothing happens. Urgent care is a much better option, then they can simply get you to inpatient care directly from there. I say that as someone who does shifts in the ER every few weekends and unless theyre in DKA we cant do much, starting someone on insulin in the ER is not something we do, we leave that for internal medicine and the inpatient floors."
BubbaChanel,2022-04-29,23,"Ugh, I spent 6 hours and $2,500 at the ER 6 months ago because of a 480.

As soon as I mentioned the 20mg/day of Prednisone Id taken the previous 5 days, everyone nodded knowingly. I sat in the ER without any intervention but the bloodwork, and it was 143 when I left at 3am."
[deleted],2022-04-29,10,"Yep. I avoid steroids like the plague. In these situations for type 2s in America reading, you can usually get short acting/regular insulin at Walmart for $25. The pharmacist on duty should be able to get it for you and help with dosing. This of course should come after drinking as much water as you can hold down. 

But in the ER, no DKA/HHS, no insulin. I dont agree that we do things this way, but I am not the person in charge. I hate seeing people waste a ton of money in the ER for something they could correct at home."
CuriouslyInept,2022-04-29,3,"I didn't know this was an option.

I guess I'd need a prescription and... talk with the endo/pharmacist about use?

[deleted],2022-04-29,2,Weird. I work at a 700 bed and we take transfers from urgent to inpatient on a semi regular basis.  Type 1s will get insulin but type 2 we essentially just give them a shit ton of fluids and an insulin drip depending on their blood work.

atrokitty,2022-04-29,3,"I WAS in DKA and still sat in the local ER for HOURS when I first found out I was diabetic. I went to a walk in clinic because I was feeling very lethargic and was throwing up constantly. They took my blood sugar (445), did a urine test for ketones (large amount), and told me to get the ER ASAP.  Walk in clinic even called ahead and told them I was coming and to be ready for me. Got there and my boyfriend immediately grabbed a wheelchair because I was feeling dizzy and weak. Sat there in the waiting room for over four hours and it wasn't until I slumped over in the wheelchair in and out of conciousness and my boyfriend panicked and ran up to the desk and said I couldn't hold my head up and wasn't responding that they finally took it seriously."
slothsRcool14,2022-04-30,3,This is insane. All I need to tell the e.r. when I go in is I'm diabetic and can't stop vomiting. I immediately get called back before everyone in the waiting room.  Sorry you were stuck waiting! That's a definite emergency!
atrokitty,2022-04-30,5,"The WORST hospital in the area. I was there for 4 days and they didn't teach me anything I needed to know about insulin or giving myself injections. Didn't give me a reference scale for units. They diagnosed me as completely insulin dependent, prescribed me insulin and basically said ""good luck"". I learned everything I know from my best friend who is T1D, watching YouTube videos, and reading books. I went from an A1C of 13.1 to 4.9 without help from an endo because the only endo in the area is the hospital endo.

They told my friend she didn't have a hernia, she just pulled muscle. She went to a different hospital and had to have surgery on hernia. They also broke a heart catheter insertion wire off in my mom's heart and had to do a full aortic valve replacement. This could be from the manufacturer, but it still happened there. 

Thank for saying that, I thought I was crazy and overreacting when it happened."

Noggin-a-Floggin,2022-04-30,1,"Yeah, urgent care is what someone should do if they have a high blood sugar.  My blood sugar was 23.7 mmol/L (I'll always remember that number) when I went there after feeling the typical symptoms for a week.  Then it was off to the ER after getting that diagnosis."

donuts_are_tasty,2022-04-29,3,This is probably the best comment to follow here. So many diabetics forget that its not necessarily common knowledge to know that you have to wash your hands before testing blood sugar that they just immediately freak out and say to go to the ER.
permalink_child,2022-04-30,3,Yeah.  OP writes below that his fingers were drenched in maple syrup when he took this test.  OPs A1C is 5.0 - so false alarm.
setyte,2022-04-29,2,"This is a very important step. I wash the heck out of my finger before testing, I also started pricking more or pushing harder to get a bit more blood so I don't need up scraping my finger to get enough blood. Usually just pushing extra hard to get the blood out works and I don't need to prick extra."
gwmccull,2022-04-29,3,I remember my diabetes educator saying that squeezing hard can squeeze out inter-cellular fluid which can throw off your reading

gwmccull,2022-04-30,1,"I find that if I sit down for a minute with my hand hanging below the seat of my chair and maybe swinging/shaking to encourage my arm to relax, then I'm able to get plenty of blood without hard squeezing.

Not sure how much hard squeezing could throw off a reading"

bling_bling2000,2022-04-29,17,"I honestly think ER is not a good option for diabetic complications. They go by the priority of severity, and there are so many issues that'll appear worse than DKA until it's way farther along than it should be. To get proper treatment when you need it, it HAS to not be a busy day at the ER, which doesn't really happen and you can't plan for it.

Urgent care will do you a lot better. They'll be a lot more inclined to test your sugar quickly in between checkups and will certainly slot you ahead or even give you an insulin drip if needed before you see the doctor. This may just be my experience, but I think it follows that a nurse will put it on themselves to give you an IV when it only takes two minutes and there's no one spraying blood everywhere at the moment.

My urgent care experience was when I was first diagnosed, and I was in the ICU being taken care of within a couple hours. My ER experience was walking in with flu symptoms and no diabetic supplies (an error, was in for other reasons and they were forgotten) where I sat for 6 hours without insulin actively entering DKA."
PaidBeerDrinker,2022-04-29,3,"I have no experience with diabetes and urgent care, but my ER experiences showed me that many doctors are apprehensive to use prescribe insulin.  At 600 because of prednisone, I had to push and push to get insulin."

friendless2,2022-04-29,62,"Drink lots of water, check for keytones (OTC test at any drug store), avoid carbohydrates (bread, rice, potatoes, regular soda, desserts, sugar, oatmeal, fruit...).

If you have large keytones, get medical attention for DKA, which make you have nausea, vomiting everything, and weak.

Make an appointment for a few blood tests.  Fasting Blood Glucose (8+ hours without any food before it), HbA1c (glucose average of the last 3 months), C-Peptide (insulin output).

Make an appointment with your regular doctor at first, but an endocrinologist may be needed if this is actually diabetes.  The blood test results will determine that.

There is a chance this is not diabetes if you are currently on some serious steroids, and other factors."

Keonexis,2022-04-29,16,"Hate to be blunt but there is no almost certainty&if this is truly your number than you are a diabetic. With a number that high you genuinely need to go to the ER. Fuck the high hospital bills costs and go. You could mourn about the loss of your pancreas later. Whats important is getting you feeling better because I bet right now you dont feel 100% and thats for a reason. The doctors will give you the medicine you need to feel better today! With a number that high, you cant fix it with just exercise and water. Last thing I want to hear is you ended up in a coma because you were planning to see a doctor and waiting for an open appointment. Go to the hospital, get better, learn what they teach you, then adapt to your new lifestyle.

With that being said welcome to the club. And if you ever need guidance or help or even emotional support, thats what this community is for. You are most diffidently not alone.

mewithoutCthulhu,2022-04-29,2,:/ I didnt even get a glucometer and my doctor never mentioned anything about one. One of the first things my wife asked was if they were going to prescribe me one. I shrugged and told her that maybe they will talk about that at my counseling appointment.
Agile_Donut_2564,2022-04-29,2,You need one asap. Can get at most pharmacies.
Agile_Donut_2564,2022-04-29,1,A lot of good info available online. Just be sure you're going to reputable medical websites. Start with diabetes.org. You can make huge difference with your numbers with diet alone. Best of luck
madpiratebippy,2022-04-29,2,"Wash your hands very carefully and check again. If the results are the same, you are diabetic. 100%. A single reading over 300 is enough for a positive diagnosis. 

Your blood sugars are high enough right now to cause issues. You need an IV with fluid push, if you don't have health insurance there's a lot of IV beauty bars popping up in the US that are a lot cheaper. Drink an assload of water, and don't eat anything with carbs in it if you don't have to until you get to a doctor. 

So. Much. Water. 

When your glucose is that high, it's actually sharp in your blood and can cause micro-cuts in the small capalaries in your body- eyes, fingers and toes are particularly sensitive to this kind of damage and if it goes on long enough it can become permanent damage. 

Chug water. LOTS of water. See if you can get an IV of saline (in my town at the 'hydration bars' or beauty bars it's done by a nurse and it's also $65 which is less than any of my co-pays) and see a doctor about getting on medication as soon as possible."
drugihparrukava,2022-04-29,3,"&gt;'hydration bars' 

I've been living under a rock it seems and had to google this. This exists? You go somewhere that's not an hospital for an IV? Wow! I can only hope the level of cleanliness and sterility matches a hospital? Do you trust said bars and IV ""health bars""?"
madpiratebippy,2022-04-29,1,"They have things like vitamin infusions and things to help with hangovers, they tend to be something like medium high end medspas. 

A lot of the vitamin infusions are for women who wear jewlery worth more than my car getting anti aging treatments, and you can find a legit one near you. 

Honestly with their clinetelle I'd be more likley to trust them being sterile than a hospital."

But, like all things, you take it one step at a time, and once you find your ""groove"" in maintaining it, it's really not that bad. Sometimes getting all your stuff down can actually be a bit of a confidence booster.

You'll have good days and bad days. Just make sure you take care of the basics and the basics will take care of you.

macadore,2022-04-29,1,If that's fasting glucose then you should contact your doctor. If it's not fasting glucose then you may or may not have a problem. A doctor can run an A1C and tell you if you have a problem or not.
Stargazer_0101,2022-04-29,1,"Go to an endo or GP and get an A1C done to make it official. The A1C tells more than Gluose level for three months, they also test other things in the blood that can alert to other health issues See about getting an appointment soon.

mensa2b,2022-04-30,1,"Please don't panic. This reading depends on a lot of things.  Did you snack in the middle of the night? What did you have for breakfast? Have you eaten anything for lunch yet? Did you eat anything in between breakfast and lunch? If you are new to all this, I urge you to try and get control over what and when you are eating. If you can do that even somewhat, you will be better off. If it turns out that you do have diabetes, your key to feeling better and pushing back complications is to gain control of you eating habits and what type of foods you are eating. I would suggest that you keep a daily journal of the times you eat and what you eat. Try to do that for a week or so. It may enlighten you a bit. If it turns out you actually do have diabetes don't panic, don't despair, and keep in touch with everyone on this website.  And remember, none of us live perfectly with diabetes. We all have good days and bed days. Myself, I get diabetes ""burnout"" from time to time.  It makes me mad but I have learned to ""get over it"" and continue on.

Change up your diet, start exercising more and drink more water. Avoid sweets, including naturally sweet fruits like oranges and bananas (Green Apples are okay in moderation). This does include fruit juices ass well. 

It probably wouldn't hurt to go on a low carb diet to help get those numbers down, but it's not necessary.

When i was diagnosed it was by chance (had yearly blood work no symptoms other than drinking a lot but i drink a lot anyways so didnt notice till afterwards (hindsight is 20/20) my fasting sugar was 217 and not fasting was easily 400-500 at the time . Also get some ketone test strips if possible and check for ketones if you have a lot of them go to the er instead as that can become life threatening very very quickly also try not to panic you will be fine just get to a dr ASAP so you can get properly diagnosed and started on medication.

But my mother worked at the local pediatrician's office and was coached by the doctor to let me manage my own disease.  From day one, at 10 years old, I have been the only one (outside of a medical professional) to draw and inject my insulin.  It gave me independence for when I left home and set me up for life.  I know diabetics who have had helicopter parents with strict rules, etc.  It's horrible.  

I can't imagine what it would be like with today's technology.  No way would I want anyone being able to see my CGM on their phone and keeping a close eye on things.  No way"
birdywrites1742,2022-04-26,56,"I had my parents call the police on me twice because they could see my number through my phone. One of the times was because I was 55 with two arrows straight down (and I wasn't responding to them although it was 4 in the morning) and I got up and handled the low, and the other time was because my CGM had lost signal (at a similar time) and I had to tell them that I didn't have signal either (something fouled up between my CGM and my phone as the receiver). You'd better believe that when I upgraded to a new system I leaned into the ""oh, this one doesn't let me share my numbers!""

With that said, I've been giving my own shots and monitoring my own situation since I was diagnosed at 6 (I'm 24 now). But my parents have been pretty helicopter-y and blamed a lot of emotional expression on my numbers (e.g. telling me to test when I was angry/upset because they thought my blood sugar was high)."
Chaostii,2022-04-26,23,"My mom forced me to check my numbers anytime I was upset (because of HER BS!) then minimized whatever I felt regardless of what the number was. She wasn't a helicopter parent though, quite the opposite; She just expected a child who was terrified of needles and had no attention span to completely manage their own heavily needle based, detail oriented disease and was pretty much never around. Spend a few years in foster care after several hospitalizations. All of this was of course somehow my fault, and was used against me consistently as an adult (I don't think I can count how many times I heard that her losing her job/insurance and mounting depression were directly my fault).

Guess who hasn't hasn't been in contact in over a decade?"
zfcjr67,2022-04-26,5,"My family is the opposite - ""you're in a foul mood because you need food!""   No, no, I just need to take a cinnamon capsule and I'll be ok."
sapphiresoaker,2022-04-27,1,Does cinnamon capsule help with your diabetes ?
zfcjr67,2022-04-27,2,"It's a joke.  There are well meaning people who will say it is the cure.  

I do like cinnamon, but use it as the good Lord intended, as a spice."
birdywrites1742,2022-04-27,2,"I have a label on my cinnamon container at home that reads, ""The Cure for Diabetes.""

My dad laughed out loud when he saw it"
zfcjr67,2022-04-27,2,"Our department has a ""wellness champion"", someone who is the cheerleader for the company wellness programs.  He went on a kick last week about drug advertising and how healthy living is better than miracle prescriptions, which I do agree.  His example was ""the magic diabetes pill that claims to lower your A1c, when the root of the problem is some people just eat too many carbs.""  Yeah, I was irritated and sent a snarky email about the pill being better than cinnamon."
beached,2022-04-26,7,"Similar, it was mine and they where there if i needed help.  No added manipulation or guilt, just something I did."
NuttyDounuts14,2022-04-26,6,"See I injected from day 1 (at the same age) because we were given a pen of water and a stress penguin to practice injecting on.

The nurse showed us all how to do it, so while I was still on IV, we all had a go with the penguin. My dad was pretty good as was my nan (one has a degree in microbiology and the other is an ex nurse who used to work the diabetes ward, so no surprise) my aunt was a bit heavy handed and my mother stabbed it.

And I mean, there was a good inch divot centered around the needle kinda stabbed it. There was no way I was letting her near me with a needle.

So I took complete control from day 1. The only exceptions I make to the ""I stab myself"" rule is vaccines and blood tests."
SallyAmazeballs,2022-04-26,2,"Wow, my parents practiced on *me* with coaching from the nurses and doctor. No penguin or orange for me! They are also farmers, so it wasn't a very big jump. They definitely liked me more than cows, but giving little calves injections and insulin injections to humans are very similar. Easy transition, apart from the emotions of stabbing your child.

I was three or four when I was diagnosed, and I think I was doing my own injections by eight or nine. Not all of them, but I definitely was by sixth grade, because that's when I got to go on sleepovers."
Brinyat,2022-04-26,1,"Blimey I'm old, I got an orange to practise on!"
NuttyDounuts14,2022-04-26,2,"Don't worry, when I was diagnosed, the Freestyle Optium was new to the market and I had to code a new test strip batch lol!"
Brinyat,2022-04-26,3,I first had to pee on a stick! I'm somewhat older by the sound of it.... just thankful how good things are now.
iamclickbaut,2022-04-26,1,"Practice on?!  I was the practice target.  Though I had received allergy shots on a daily basis for years, then since weened off, but I was definitely used to needles.  So when I was diagnosed, my nurse just watched me inject myself (in my arm at the time) and she was impressed that I could both pinch my arm and insert the syringe and dispense all with one hand."
Brinyat,2022-04-27,3,"I was a 'bit' more difficult to put it lightly. To make me do my jab the nurses locked 7 year old me in a room, left the syringe and said do or die... so I climbed out the window! They were somewhat harsh in the 70s!"
iamclickbaut,2022-04-27,2,Sounds like a future saw movie....
diabeticgal,2022-04-26,2,"We were diagnosed the same year! And, yeah, my endo made sure my parents knew that I needed to be taught how to manage because I'd be on my own eventually."
Informal-Release-360,2022-04-27,2,Im glad Im not the only one that doesnt like others seeing my bg. When I was in my house ( toxic environment in general ) they were constantly telling me what I was doing wrong. The only one on it now is my boyfriend and thats so if I dont wake up to a low he can wake me up.
Hazelstone37,2022-04-26,74,"Im a parent of a person who has T1D. I agree. I really hate when parents use we language when talking about dealing with their kids diabetes management. Its a fine line to walk. We were up all night managing a high blood sugar I think is fine. We were up all night because our blood sugar was high, is problematic. 

I volunteer with an organization where I get to interact with parents a lot. What can I do to help parents deal with you better?"
reconciliationisdead,2022-04-26,38,"Not OP, but I think encouraging parents to seek therapy where available would go a long way. I think a lot of people see the anxiety and helicoptering as justifiable so they let it continue. It hurts the child. Kids need to feel confident in managing their disease in an age appropriate way, not scared to go to sleep because their parent is afraid they'll die. The anxiety of raising a kid with T1 needs to stay among adults and be dealt with by professionals, not downloaded onto kids"
megavoid,2022-04-26,11,"I agree, and thank you for articulating what I couldn't in my anger. We rightfully encourage people to seek out treatment for PPA, but tend to forget about parents after that. Honestly, I think pediatricians who interact with parents of chronically ill children should be able to screen for parental issues like extreme anxiety and depression. 

Again, I'm not dismissing anyone's anxiety, I just don't want it to be so quickly embraced as positive or used to speak over others who are actually dealing with the disease. Therapy is great and some of those parents would really benefit from it (as would their kids)."
Brinyat,2022-04-26,3,"Or maybe better training by health services on what their kids are going through?

However, being a patent of a young Diabetic can be very difficult and they do need support. Counselling after if that does not work, again the priority should be diabetic knowledge and support."
nrgins,2022-04-26,1,"It sounds like the issue with you being kicked out of the group wasn't so much about what you said but about how you said it. If you said it in a very angry, dismissive way, then I could see that would be a reason to be kicked out. On the other hand, if you had said it politely and with compassion, the same message probably could have been conveyed without you being kicked out. That would be my guess."
megavoid,2022-04-26,1,"No, it was my opinion. Without going into specifics the admin took some pretty intense steps to make sure anyone with a certain opinion had their comments deleted and then made another big dramatic post about it."
nrgins,2022-04-26,1,That's too bad. Sorry they took that approach.
diggabytez,2022-04-27,3,"This we business drives me absolutely nuts. 

These helicopter parents are watching live updates of glucose readings 24/7, texting their teen / young adult children constantly and even setting remote overrides of their pumps (!!!). This is horrendous and sets a terrible precedent.

Young diabetics will never learn to manage the disease effectively on their own with someone micromanaging it for them constantly."
Leftover81,2022-04-26,25,I hope that by the time my 6 year with T1 will be on her own by 25.
ARealBlueFalcon,2022-04-27,1,My kid is at 11. It gets way easier
Dropitlikeitscold555,2022-04-27,1,Yup my 12 yr old changes his omnipods himself now
NuttyDounuts14,2022-04-26,70,"Considering my mum spent the first year of my diagnosis making it about her ""PTSD"" (never actually got it diagnosed, therefore it gets quotation marks) and would take over my therapy appointments for my T1 with what was going on in her life, I do think there should be separate groups.

It's great when parents want to come on and ask more experienced T1s for advice, especially about how to let their kids have control of their own condition, however, it does seem like many T1 parents act like military wives, especially on the groups FOR T1.

And that's the difference, parents should be in groups ABOUT T1 and parent support groups, T1s themselves should have about groups and for groups. We need a space to vent and be supported for our feelings, parents need one for theirs and then we can help each other in an about group."
Starseid8712,2022-04-26,17,"Right. I'm a 30+ year Type I who **finally** has some form of control over this disease. My older sister's daughter was just diagnosed last January with T1. I can help my sister with my experiences, but I can't fathom the stressors she's facing, especially considering I've only ever known diabetes and her daughter now has this paradigm shift of what once was versus what now is. We can offer *some* support as fellow diabetics, but that doesn't make us experts in regard to the anxiety of parenting a diabetic child too."
megavoid,2022-04-26,25,"I 100% wish there was a way to make the groups separated without losing some of the valuable knowledge. For example, a lot of parents are great with insurance and devices and I would hate to lose that knowledge. But, I think military wives is a great comparison here--there is a certain kind of parent who makes their kids disease their identity (as you unfortunately seem to know!) and I'm just so over them making it all about their feelings."
reconciliationisdead,2022-04-26,9,Like a dia-dependa lol
BecauseSheSaySo,2022-04-26,8,"We need to make ""Proud parent to a pancreatic reject"" bumper stickers."
Thriss13,2022-04-26,4,"I think having separate groups would be fine and not risk losing knowledge between them IF parents understood boundaries and belonged to multiple groups. If they understood the general T1 group they're part of is focused on the experience of people who actually have it, and therefore they should save the posts about their own personal gripes and freakouts for the group that focuses on parents and loved ones. But that's just it - getting people to understand boundaries."
Brinyat,2022-04-26,3,My mum threw a telephone at the psychologist!
shannon_nonnahs,2022-04-26,50,"For me it's the boyfriends and girlfriends who go online and post about their partners health for advice without really understanding what they're asking or not wanting their partner to know they asked. It's controlling behavior, and parents of t1d get stuck in this too as their kids get older. We need to be able to manage diabetes without micromanaging diabetics (grown)."
reconciliationisdead,2022-04-26,11,"I hate that people try to give them a lot of specific advice about how to support the diabetic partner. When people comment that *only the diabetic partner can decide how they want to be supported* they get down voted for being ""negative"""
Kaleandra,2022-04-26,11,"The partners are more of a concern, agreed. Sometimes it feels like they want to parent their partner? 

I get parents who are worried about their kids dying in their sleep, over- or under dosing insulin and causing damage, denying sugar bombs or misdosing for them. It's a lot to deal with. Clearly, the kid should have more and more control and handle their own care by the time they're an adult, but I understand if a parent has a hard time letting go"
catnik,2022-04-26,6,"There was a really infuriating AITA post the other day where a guy blamed his sister-in-law for his T1 brother's mismanagement of his condition, which led to the brother being hospitalized."
megavoid,2022-04-26,4,"It's probably no surprise but that post made me lose my mind! And, it all started because the brother never learned to deal with his diabetes and his parents enabled it."
catnik,2022-04-26,3,Right?  I swore too much in my response and got modded. C'est la vie.
courdeloofa,2022-04-26,2,There are always those SOs who just dont know where to start in understanding (or the just new to dating a T1D) who we need to made sure we dont scare off.  Sometimes they dont understand and need another persons description or tip or advice.    But the controlling SOs: they can go pound sand!
EICzerofour,2022-04-26,15,"It reminds me of autism parents, which is sick to me. Stop makimg a personality around your kids desease or disability. Questions are fine, but a community of these parents are the most frustrating things in the world for me."
larsonsam2,2022-04-26,10,"&gt;unable to let their 25 year old leave for a trip overnight without breaking down due to worry needs to get help, cause yikes...

I can relate to this. It's super frustrating when parents melt down from worry about me, especially when they have my 3 brothers to worry about. It makes me feel fragile.

That's why I think parents, spouses, and loved ones of diabetics *do* need a safe space to talk, without much interference from us."
Rockitnonstop,2022-04-26,33,"I think it is hard for parents to let go. I still see mine react strongly to me (at age 36) if I start to yawn over at their house (are you low? do you need a snack? How are your levels?) even if it is just because of normal reasons (went to a concert the night before and was up until 3am). I firmly assert that things are fine, and tell them not to worry. I also dont put up with the helicopter stuff. However, it is important to remember that even though they didnt have diabetes themselves, they did have to treat it 24/7 while I was too young to do so (diagnosed at 2). For that, they will be the closest persons to really understand what I went through, because they were there too. Being mindful that it probably wasnt fun for them either, I try to approach it with a sense of empathy. 

Of course, there are the extremes of people that dont get it. That is where I stick to facts. Try and leave the personal comments and emotional response out of it. It works for the most part, but online it is tricky. Remember that they are learning from you, and that can be a really frustrating journey. If they kick you out because of emotional reasons, it probably wasnt a healthy platform to be on. Hopefully there is another one that can serve your needs better."
mm825,2022-04-26,8,"&gt; it is important to remember that even though they didnt have diabetes themselves, they did have to treat it 24/7 while I was too young to do so

Seriously, they have to deal with so much uncertainty and lack of control. I'm in my 30's too and just count myself lucky that my parents still care enough about my health to ask me if I need some sugar every once and a while"
MSV34,2022-04-26,0,"With all due respect, if my parents asked me about my diabetes after I yawned, Id stop speaking to them."
Dense-Scientist-9101,2022-04-26,5,"To be fair, I think it'll depend on the parents and the kid. When my blood sugar was messed up id get really tired, so they'd check on me. Not defending helicopter parents because mom was one but still"
MSV34,2022-04-26,4,"Right - it depends on the KID. the poster is a 36 year old who very clearly explained they were out late at a concert. Yawning is expected, not a symptom of hypo. 

This subreddit clearly doesnt understand reading comprehension. Sad. Maybe thats a diabetic symptom too."
Dense-Scientist-9101,2022-04-26,1,"I wasn't saying it is, but I'm saying that it'll be common for the parents to check if it's a hypo symptom, as some parents tend to worry regardless of what the situation may be."
Rockitnonstop,2022-04-27,1,"Haha I hear you. For me, constant yawning is an early sign of a hypo. So they arent wrong to ask as I know there were a few times in my childhood that it ended with me passing out and seizuring. Kind of like how every time I drop something heavy in the house I yell IM FINE! to my husband. Again, it comes from loud crashes that accompanied me passing out from a low sugar."
Amelindinum,2022-04-27,1,"At 28 I can't even glance at my pump without my entire family freaking out. ""Omg are you okay, what's wrong, did you mess up?"" And then they don't believe me when I tell them I'm just checking to see what my blood sugar is, or what time it is, or doing the routine things to make sure I *am* okay. I don't know what they think I've been doing during the decade since I moved out that would necessitate such helicoptering, I obviously know how to manage on my own!"
CosmicSmackdown,2022-04-26,9,"I see both sides of this issue. I understand where OP is coming from because I see this a lot in Facebook groups, also. I get a bit frustrated by it but I just scroll on unless I have something that might be helpful to contribute. 

OP, youre not alone. I dont feel quite as strongly as you do about it but I understand your perspective. I know a lot of people on FB who feel the way you do. Have you considered starting a group for adults with diabetes? You can certainly do that and even make it off limits to parents of kids with T1 if you feel the need."

courdeloofa,2022-04-26,7,"Agree 100%. (Facebook sucks).  However, Ive started to learn in Reddit which are more the subs that are more relevant.  TBH this sub isnt my go-to sub.  I find this one has a mix of everyone. T1D, T2D, parents etc.   So I read and scroll usually.

europeandaughter12,2022-04-26,7,i just got diagnosed this year at 29 and i feel like 80% of facebook groups meant to be for t1s are parents of t1s. most of them have no idea how to use a search function or should really be asking the kid's doctor their questions. i like this space a lot more.
coffeemonster1983,2022-04-26,25,"I am a parent of a Type 1. He is 9, was diagnosed at 2. I consider myself reasonable laid back, and am currently in the process of handing off a lot of his care onto him so he has the responsibility (not all, but some in readiness for him moving to secondary school (UK) in just over a year). We have mastered most things, still growth spurts and illness can throw us for a loop but we manage and move on. That being said, I can't begin to describe the fear I have every single night that one day I will put him to bed and he won't wake up. The fear that one day something will happen and he won't get the help he needs. We are going to have to navigate puberty, drinking, moving out and honestly as a parent it is a genuinely terrifying prospect. I'm not scared of my kid getting into trouble or hanging with the wrong crowd. I am straight up scared he will die. So I do inderstand where you are coming from, I myself am not a type 1 diabetic so I can't imagine how frustrating online forums can be, but please give us parents a little slack, especially the ones without the personal experience to fall back on."
beached,2022-04-26,14,Your kid fears it too.  I was in my 30s when I stopped fearing that.  The difference was a cgm and a pump that did temp basal lowering when lows are predicted.  The cgm was the sleep aid though.  I could go to sleep knowing it would yell at me if i needed to care.
coffeemonster1983,2022-04-26,5,"I must admit I am very reassured by how quickly diabetes technology has advanced in the 7 years since his diagnosis, we have another 8-9 years until we need to consider him potentially moving to university so who knows what life will look like then. I hope it is enough for him to feel safe to do what he would like, I hate the thought that he is afraid too, but I am sure you are right."
beached,2022-04-26,6,"There are groups that help them realize that the D doesnt have to stop them.  A good one in Canada is I Challenge Diabetes, founded by an Olympic rower who has T1.  I had the opportunity to talk to Sébastien Sasseville, A Canadian T1 that climbed everest and ran accross Canada, a few years ago and one thing he said really hit home.  It was about the people he climbed with and it came down to, we all have our challenges.  If one wants to do something, find a way.  T1 can be just another challenge to overcome on the path to our goals.  That is downplaying it a bit but it is the cards we are dealt."

coffeemonster1983,2022-04-26,6,Learn how to drink alcohol safely! I was a teenager once! His dietitian has already suggested when he is older we need to discuss with him how to treat alcohol differently to other food/drink. This is new to me as I don't have type 1 and am already prepared to let him have his freedom as a young adult but I know the mother in me will be waiting at home with a cheese toastie for him!
blublubpomeranian,2022-04-26,10,"Oh yeah drinking is tough sometimes. I was more talking about the we language. I think someone made a comment down below about this& its a tricky thing to keep an eye on but it kind of represents an ownership over another persons diabetes that isnt yours. Im sorry to point that out but I do believe that is one of the issues the op had raised.. you used we in your comment so many times it def squicked me a lil bit .. He, your son, will have to navigate drinking. You will not. Truly sorry if that sounds SO harsh over Reddit but my parents did that to me and I had to learn to shut that down. It comes from love but its pretty infantilizing.. you just might not realize it."
coffeemonster1983,2022-04-26,8,"Sorry, I use 'we' as my son is a little reluctant to do too much himself (nervous, it's a lot to take, hence why we are passing on responsibility slowly) so have always said we are his team. Like in formula 1, he is the driver and we are his pit stop team, for when he needs us. He is currently 9, one of the youngest in his school year and struggles academically. We still use 'we' more for his reassurance that he doesn't have to do it alone. I also have a very confident and independent 11 year old, so I am very well aware that he will need his team less and less, and 'we' won't be needed, it will be 'him'. But while he needs me (and is his decision how much he needs me, I assure you) I will continue to be part of his 'pit stop team'. When I say 'we' will help him navigate drinking, we will be helping him. I will sit him down and discuss drinking/food/when to bolus or not safely the same way I will discuss safe sex, respect, consent and other conversations that should be had with a teenager. The use of 'we' is very much alive in my house until he doesn't need it. Again, this is when he decides, not me. Remember, he is still only 9!"
ponzLL,2022-04-26,1,"I'm in literally this exact same position current age and age of diagnosis and everything and you addressed my feelings perfectly. We're also starting to hand off a lot more of the responsibility to him, and he's doing a great job taking it on as well!

I'm curious, do you have a CGM? We didn't have a single restful night in the first 6 or so years before getting one, and when we finally got one, it was a huge relief for all of us just being able to go to sleep without worry, for the most part."
coffeemonster1983,2022-04-26,1,"We do! It is a little temperamental at the moment (sensors are frequently inaccurate and he sleeps through the alarms), but very soon (in the next few weeks!) he is getting a new/improved one. It is amazingly reassuring, on nights when I know the sensor is accurate it's like ""no news is good news"" so if I don't hear an alarm I know he is fine!"

culdesacrilege,2022-04-26,5,"As it happens, I'm a parent of an adult with a different chronic condition that requires lifelong management. I can't stress enough how important it is to encourage autonomy, which definitely means different things as kids grow up. Not only because parents will be there less, but because it's a series of gradual lessons in planning, self care, and self-advocating. I'm totally sure that I'm less anxious now because I know my kid is as equipped as they can be to deal with whatever comes along.

Also: I wish more Internet groups were better at defining themselves. If the purpose of a T1D group is actually support for caregivers, that's how it should refer to itself!"
stephknits,2022-04-26,6,"I have type 1 and am also a parent of a now 18 Yr old type 1, diagnosed at 16 during lockdown.

I was lucky in that they were already old enough to take on management by themselves, so I never had to go through the letting go process.  I have never followed their blood sugar on their libre, as it is their diabetes, not mine.  

We do discuss stuff and help each other actually and to be fair, I do most of the remembering to order prescriptions, but they do all their management, carb counting etc.  

I see a lot of parents worrying about their teenagers, especially at night, but am also lucky in that regard as I only got use of the libre for myself about a year, so have spent many years waking myself up with a hypo.  It is obviously a concern, but not one that overtakes me.

I do get that having been the one managing the condition for years for your kid, that it is hard to let go, but I do find it hard to read posts from parents who let their anxieties get the better of them.  I feel sorry for the kids.  

I was once answering a post from a parent wanting advice about letting go and I was giving a tip, whilst also explaining and being mindfull of how it is easy for me to say.  I got an angry response from another parent who said how sad it was that I didn't care for my kid and that they would never not make their kid's blood sugar levels their business.  I thought about how funny it would be if at 50,my 81 Yr old mother was following me on the libre app - she wouldn't know how to turn it on!  

As someone else posted, I do find parents who use we and our diabetes a struggle and also have a bit of an issue with all the talk of warriors and heros (this really winds my 18 Yr old up)."
mymourningwood,2022-04-26,5,"Damn I saw the post youre talking about. For anyone not in the particular group this woman was talking about literally shaking and sobbing in fear for her 25 year old who was going away for the weekend.

Rebootkid,2022-04-26,5,"parent's view here.

1) I absolutely agree that the person with the disease has the final say in how their diabetes is managed.

2) Some diabetic children need a crapload of support. My kid, if I don't hound him, will absolutely ignore his diabetes, chug a mountain dew, and end up in the hospital with DKA. I have multiple ER bills to prove this.

3) Some parents have a hard time letting their kids mature. Even though I know my kid when he's gonna spend a weekend with his buddies, he's gonna do stupid shit, he's gonna go high, and I'm gonna have to spend all weekend texting him, ""hey man, can you correct please?""  I still gotta let him go. he's gotta do this on his own. ER bills included, I'm afraid.

Does any of that mean I'm not worried? hell no. That's my kid. I worry about him 24x7x365, independent of his disease. I worry about all my children constantly. I still let them go live their lives, because doing otherwise is just doing them a disservice."
Animanic1607,2022-04-26,4,"For me, it's the entitlement that others think they can over me when it comes to my care. After I was diagnosed, there was a marked difference in how I was treated, and often I am only seen for my being Type 1 and not as myself. It's caused enough frustration, especially after I started to speak up about it, that I no longer trust them with any of it. I had a really serious low over the last weekend, and no one in my family knows about it.  

I still maintain bodily autonomy and I am a functioning adult. Unless I am asking for help, I don't need or want it."
beached,2022-04-26,9,"Some observations, that parents who make it their job to manage their t1 child's diabetes sometimes to the exclusion of the child with it a) don't teach their child to confidently deal and manage it themselves b) setup for the child rebelling and using diabetes as a form of asserting control c) lose their childs trust and when shit hits the fan, it will, it becomes a personal failure and not something to work on together"
NnQM5,2022-04-26,3,"I mean I do think their feelings should be validated but it definitely should be more about the kids. I just know that having your child come so close to death (hypoglycemia, hospitalization) especially multiple times can be traumatizing for many."

It was rough at the start for sure, but he is 8 years in at this point, it is just his life. And if I freak out constantly he will feel like an oddball or a burden. He already feels bad people dont get to sleep through the night all the time. Parents that do shit like this are making it about them oh poor me my kid has the sweet blood.

AggressiveOsmosis,2022-04-26,14,"I think that being a parent of a T1 child is probably one of the most difficult things a parent can go through because their child is always on the knife edge of dying. Of course their anxiety is through the roof. And of course its different than the actual suffer of T1. In many ways its easier to be the person with the one dealing with your things then it is to be a parent Who cant  actually control everything. And when you have a child, the love you feel, the fear, the anxiety, it is almost indescribable. And then to have that child of T1 and one wrong move and they can die every day? No way, nightmare fuel.

I would almost say this could be an age issue. The older I get the more terrified for any parent that has a T1 child. Especially the younger they are. Because its very hard to keep them alive. And the older I get the more I realize the harder it is to keep the children alive. So maybe you do need more compassion."
wiedmaier,2022-04-26,12,"Going through a hypo for me is scary but I giggle when my brain isnt firing on all cylinders and its terrifying but also not a bad time.

I had to call 911 for my T1 dad a few times and its fucking terrifying.

I can, and do, cheerfully endure the shitty health I have been dealt.  But my kids?  Fuuuuuuuck I would trade all of their sickness and illness and take it on myself if I could.  I would endure a lot of pain just to make sure they were ok.

It is multiple orders of magnitude to go through something yourself as opposed to having to sit there helpless while your kids suffer."
AmericanGirl1493,2022-04-27,2,"I realize that offering unsolicited advice is not everyone's cup of tea, but I'm going to share because this comment really stood out to me. 

I've lived with T1D for 25+ years - when I was diagnosed my parents were in their early 30s and terrified. Our family pediatrician of many years sat them down and told them to treat me like a totally normal, healthy child and that if they would have let me do an activity without diabetes, they need to let me pursue it despite T1D. Their following of that advice was the best thing my parents could have *ever* done for me.

Growing up they let me try out for any sports team I wanted, went to sleepovers and birthday parties, summer camps etc. You name it, I was doing it. At times I know it was incredibly stressful for my parents, but having the mindset that living with diabetes won't hold me back was so empowering and I can't thank my parents enough for that. They encouraged me to take ownership of my health and stressed the importance of taking care of myself, but they never made me feel like my diabetes was something to be afraid of. 

Since then, I made it through college at a top university where I studied abroad, I have run multiple marathons in my life and am now pursuing a career in a stressful, fast-paced industry that frequently requires travel. I struggle with anxiety from living with a chronic illness, and it's not easy, but I maintain good control and do the best that I can every day. 

I'm not saying this to brag or to say that I have all of the answers, but I think it's so important to understand that positioning diabetes as something to be terrified of is not doing your child any service in the long-run. With good control, you are *not* ""on the knife edge of dying"" every day and I would encourage you to re-frame how you think about this disease."
Stargazer_0101,2022-04-26,4,And parents are parents for life. Their job is to worry for their kids from birth to adulthood and beyond. You can ask your own parents and they would tell you that they are still worried about you as parents. OP is apparently not a parent and needs to learn more about the affects of type 1 children. No health issue is easy on parents.
megavoid,2022-04-26,4,"I have a tremendous amount of compassion, especially as a parent myself. Of course we worry for our kids! But I don't think it's okay to say that the diabetic's feelings aren't valid because the parent is dealing with anxiety. That's not fair, especially to older diabetics.

Also, no, it's not easier to have diabetes than to live someone with it. Um, no. That's the kind of thinking that really irks me.

ETA: Guys, seriously, I'm saying....neither is easy and it's not a contest and that's a weird way to think. Why is that so controversial?"
AggressiveOsmosis,2022-04-26,9,"Oh I think having an infant with type one diabetes is far harder than being an adult with type one diabetes. And Ive been in and out of the hospital constantly. Lol. I dont think your parents feeling supersedes the child or an adult child, but I cannot overstate how horrible I think it would be to be the parent of a T1.

I think youre kind of taking this the wrong way, Im not saying that the parents feelings are more important, Im just saying I understand why they freak out and cant give up the control. Doesnt mean the adult child needs to acquiesce to the parents."
megavoid,2022-04-26,6,I agree it would be hard to have a child with type 1. But all I'm asking is for those parents to understand when their voices need to be the loudest and when they need to step back and realize that their experiences don't supercede the voices of those with the disease. You can understand why someone is anxious without approving of their behavior.
AggressiveOsmosis,2022-04-26,0,"I guess I need to ask how their voices are superseding others? If youre on a forum in which people are there to voice their concerns or other issues, then theyre there to speak out on those things. Youre going into an environment where people are there to expressed their opinions. Maybe you need to change where you go to get your support. Because obviously you might need a different support system than the parents. And it sounds like youre triggered by the parents having concerns and needs of their own."
megavoid,2022-04-26,8,"I do need a separate suport system then the parents, but it's impossible to find spaces where type 1 parents aren't inserting themselves and making it about their anxieties. That's what I'm saying. No need to be so condescending about it."

Its a million times easier for me to have full blown t1 diabetes than for my child to be facing the thought of t2.

Clearly you dont have kids.  A parents anxieties are incredible legitimate in a diabetes support forum.  Dont go around invalidating other people because they dont live up to the arbitrary legitimacy you seem to give to some people but not others.

megavoid,2022-04-26,10,Soo clearly I came here to rant and also I have kids. I am in no way suggesting that any parent's anxiety isn't legitimate. My request is just that parents of children with diabetes not make every conversation all about them. That's all!

Its a support forum.  Parents of T1s need a lot more support than we do.  I have a hard enough time and I can feel how my blood sugar effects me.  I cannot imagine trying to manage this bullshit for someone else.

But she was able to birth two children and ran from an abusive husband. But I did not have her when I had my second bypass and replaced my aortic valve with a St. Jude's aortic valve, leaflet and when I got diagnosed with type 2. My father had it and remember it was in the 80's and they has strips that you had to pee on to get glucose reading. it is so much easier with the meter and a drop of blood on the strip.

Totally understandable but I dont think its a fair opinion of T1 parents. The horror that a parent goes through is unimaginable in my opinion. I would much rather suffer from something horrible then have a loved one suffer from something horrible. Its pretty much that simple.  And thats the nightmare the parents are going through.

Theres always exceptions to the rule, and maybe the OP as a parent thats so horrifically abusive that they deserve this type of outcry. But in general, overall, I would say the average T1 parent deserves far more compassion than this post allows. Lol"
megavoid,2022-04-26,18,"Excuse me? I am in my 30s with a child, but even if I was young and childless I would still be entitled to this opinion. I had wonderful parents who helped me learn to be independent with my diabetes and who gave me both the  tools to manage my diabetes and the grace to learn from mistakes, and when I needed it, the support to make corrections. All I am asking is for parents of type 1s to not make themselves the center of every conversation about diabetes to the point that they are dismissive of diabetics who actually have the disease. I'm not dismissing anyone's anxiety, I'm merely asking that it doesn't take precedence over the experiences of people with the disease."

It not hard on her, she saw she had nothing to worry about. And as I grew to an adult, she admitted her worries and I was more worried for her, she had RA all her life.

Pssst3,2022-04-26,2,"A parent who is hovering over a 25 year old is rightfully concerned that others will discover they were a poor parent.   Two hundred fifty years ago life expectancy was 35-40 years. 20 years old was early middle age, and 30 was old enough to be a grandparent. 

I have a zoo of pet peeves. One that just won't go away is old children.  Those are people old enough to hold a job and procreate, but haven't learned how to function responsibly and independently, or who have chosen not to. 

The Peter Pan Syndrome is a poor description because the Peter Pan of the book was surrounded by danger and acted bravely to defend himself and others. 

Part of being an adult is being able to accept reality and the second part is working with it.  Old children don't.   

imo A parents primary duty is to help their offspring become competent adults. They assumed that obligation when they became a parent.  Whether they chose to or not, they should know whether they are competent adults. and equipped to raise children without assistance.  

A five year old knows when they need help.  Twenty-five years is twenty years longer than necessary for a parent to find that help, connect it with their offspring and learn to test and trust  the skills."

They are all seemingly incapable of understanding that their childs diagnosis isnt somehow their own identity, separating themselves from it, or adequately preparing said children for adult life with a chronic illness without a lot of constant help from mommy or daddy. They actively desire for their grown kids to be helpless and depend on them. 

I gave up on my own mother years ago because of issues like this - shes a nurse, and wouldnt you know it, shes the worlds expert on ALL kinds of diabetes, and not only am I doing a HORRIBLE job of managing myself because I check my BG frequently (or at all, honestly - it got so bad at one point that I didnt dare check around her because she would insert herself into the situation - I remember one occasion clearly when I was on G5 still and we were at an event during a sensor warm up and I had warned her my CGM would beep and I would need to calibrate it with two readings, and she was initially like okay, whatever but then when it actually happened and I did do just that, it was a constant stream of OMG are you okay, youre checking again, is something actually WRONG??!! - I read her the riot act, in public, and I think some of the inappropriateness of how she was acting sunk in) and take insulin with (*gasp*) every meal, I must also have some sort of freak variant of T1 that makes this some kind of a necessity, because that isnt how diabetes works. No mom, thats exactly how diabetes works and its actually your lack of education and any updated information on managing diabetes in general, not just T1.

Funny thing is that my step mom is also a nurse and shes awesome - literally never hassles me at all, even told my step brother (who was 14 or 15 at the time?) to stop asking me dumb questions (I did make it clear I didnt mind at all).

MinuteAcceptable4584,2022-04-27,2,"I remember around when I was diagnosed, I was about 18 and knew I was diabetic before the doctors officially diagnosed me (had all the symptoms, and when I tested myself on my dad's machine I was HIGH). For some reason, it took about 3 months to get properly diagnosed even though i had high sugar, had moderate keytones and had lost a bunch of weight. My mom insisted on taking me to every appointment that led to my diagnosis, which I was grateful for because I was really scared, but the day my family doctor sent me to the hospital she said ""I can't believe I'm the one who HAS to take you to the hospital, this isn't fair to me!!""

This is every parents worst nightmare who has a diabetic child- outliving their child. My nephew was 34- he was amazing and had a huge support group including family, and he was well-educated regarding diabetes, but it still wasnt a cake walk for him (I credit him for educating my sis and myself about Dexcom and the tslim. He and my sis use/ed both- I use the cgm). It doesnt matter that my sis is a diabetic- she knows the pitfalls and hardships of diabetes: she was so worried as a mother that her son would probably experience those same pitfalls. Im guessing most younger diabetics make it to older age in spite of their experiences with this shitty disease (my sister and I both did), but not everyone does, and perhaps parents of diabetics are acutely aware of this potential when they reach out to other people on these platforms.

So if you cannot cope with their being a parent, just do not respond, go to the next person who has no kids with type 1.

OF course he understands this and confides in me when it gets frustrating, but he understands even thought he is 30 years old, he can see how his health takes a emotional toll on his loved ones."
ghoulsmashrr,2022-04-26,1,"I was diagnosed in 1994. My mom was already a ball of anxiety but when that happened she became so wracked with fear. It really traumatized her to watch her two year old almost die and then diagnosed with a disease for life. Its horrible for parents to have to go through that and taking care of a diabetic kid is a lot of work. They need the support groups.  They need a safe space to talk about what they are dealing with, ask advice, etc. They cant show the kid how scared they are because they need to be a rock for them. I know you mean well, but these spaces arent for us and we should respect that."
megavoid,2022-04-26,5,"I'm not talking about support groups for parents, I'm talking about general groups to troubleshoot things like cgms and insulin pumps and other diabetes issues. Which, as a diabetic, I have."
soninicole33,2022-05-01,2,"That's really well said, it really resonates with me! I've been Type 1 since I was 16 and my parents weren't smart so all the management was up to me from day 1. Now my young child is going to start insulin any day soon and I'm so worried about it even though it hasn't happened yet!"
crappysurfer,2022-04-26,1,"It's a FB group, there will always be a not so insignificant portion of people who are there for validation and attention. I'd find a group with more strict rules if you want to be a part of that kind of community. I'd probably leave if it were a whine fest of diabetic parents, like fuck off.

Once you control your diabetes and have it on lock it's really not that bad. Parents should go to a support group or therapy, not a diabetic group."
VladTepesDraculea,2022-04-26,1,"Self-pity by anyone disservices everyone. This includes parents and diabetics alike. There are real strugles associated with diabetes, namely complications in the long term specially due to poor management and sometimes struggle to get meds, like in the States, or getting decent professional care - but beyond that any comunity that promotes self-pity is doing harm, not good. And I've been vocal about this here as well.

People need to accept the hand they were given and do their best to contain the issue. The correct answer to the majority of people saying ""my kid has diabetes, it's so hard"" or to ""I have diabetes, it's so hard"" is ""no it's not, is manageable, you'll get use to it and we're here to help you and support you and you can live a normal life as long as you're responsible, you'll get use to it"", else the consequences of mismanagement are the real awfulness and self-pity is the #1 enabler in my experience in mismanagement, being ""I can't do this, I'm giving up"" or teenage angst or whatever.

&gt; and also suggest that a parent who is unable to let their 25 year old leave for a trip overnight without breaking down due to worry needs to get help, cause yikes

This also goes all against that message exactly. Also at 25 it's his responsability, he's an adult."
shiggysupremacy,2022-04-26,1,"My parents can be a bit strict sometimes but I know they're just worried. But it also doesn't justify some things, but when I was talking to my mom abt diabetes once she knows that no matter how horrible it is for them, it'll always be worse for me. I know they got super scared when I had to go to the er in the middle of the night by ambulance cause I was continuously throwing up and couldn't get any nutrients or carbs in me, but it was back in january and I'm still traumatized. Ex. If I start feeling nauseous now I'll panic and my brain instantly starts wondering if it's gonna happen again."

annasbananas_,2022-04-27,1,"My mom carries a lot of irrational guilt because she cant take my disease away, and always worries when I have my bad days. If the child is the only one in the family who has been diagnosed, it can be very overwhelming and confusing for parents, which takes a mental toll. Im not a parent, but imagining my future child having an incurable/exhausting disease would definitely make me want to turn to others for some comfort/relatable friendships. I definitely get your side of it, but also think its normal for parents to ask for mental/emotional support of their own when navigating an autoimmune disease within a family

*im 25 now, t1 for 14 years, and my mom still checks in to make sure Im ok every single day - and giving her that peace of mind makes me happy because I know it helps her to feel less helpless*"
Bexileem,2022-04-27,1,My parents absolutely understand that while they had a hard time adapting to it and unsure how to manage it best (diagnosed in 1997 as a 6 year old) they also understand its my disease and Ive been injecting and carb counting since I was 8. Parents of type1 diabetics need their own pages and spaces to band together if they want support. Type 1 diabetic pages should be for the TYPE 1 DIABETIC. We dont have to show you sympathy. We can empathise sure. But we live with the disease personally. I live with my diabetes and the consequences of my control. Sure its stressful being a type1 parent but you dont come on to a page full of people living with the disease themselves and talk about how hard it is being a parent of someone with that disease.

They're awful, but so many Albertans are complete idiots so they'll probably get voted in again. For those who don't know, Alberta is the most conservative province in Canada.

The stupidest thing about this is that removing coverage for insulin pumps won't even save money. Taking away the tools that diabetics use to better manage their condition will put more of them in the hospital, which will cost the province more money in the long run."
Weekly_Research_,2022-05-12,26,"I 100% Agree, and I told Tyler Shandro this when my naaiive mind didn't fathom that they would do this. 

Being on the pump program was amazing. It helped me out in so many ways. 30 days supply covered for everything. Every 30 days. 

With this being taken away, people who don't have good enough jobs for benefits, and people who have low income jobs with some benefits could still severely struggle. 30 days supply is well over 1k, if I can remember a box of sites is around a couple hundred. Who the hell has that kind of money when rent and food and gas is going to keep going up too."

A small sharps container isn't pocket sized and if I got stopped and frisked by police, there's a small chance a cap would pop off and the officer ends up with my syringe stuck in his finger.

And for what so that they can benefit for more money by scrapping or limiting what type 1 diabetics get as their ESSENTIAL LIFE SAVING MEDICATION. Everyday I get another reason why I wouldnt want to move to North America.

courdeloofa,2022-05-12,2,"Having to go through private insurance in the USA is why the USA generally sucks for T1Ds.  Personally, I have always had to choose where I worked based upon the insurance provided.  I had to and still must pass on jobs I would have greatly enjoyed because either they didnt offer insurance or their deductible was over 5k a year before the insurance started paying.    Fuck, I got married because of health insurance (so I had back up if my position was cut the first couple years I was there)

I have a Cadillac health insurance with an excellent union and even with that I must set aside at least $2000 minimum every year for known out of pocket expenses.

SCorpus1980,2022-05-12,1,"Like I said, I have been a Type 1 diabetic for over a quarter century, and I have lived and worked all over. I have had student health plans, I've had HMOs with FSAs, I've been on high deductible PPOs with an HSA, and I've been on Medicaid. I understand the hassles and the considerations of choosing plans and jobs based on health needs.  Like many I was alive when we had to buy COBRA between jobs so our diabetes didn't somehow turn into a pre-existing condition. I have bitched and moaned many times about health care expenses.   

But with all of that, I am alive, I am healthy, and I have never had to pay full price for an insulin pump.  And this thread was started by a person in Canada (where they have universal health care) because the government might decide not to cover insulin pumps there.

Don't get me wrong, I personally favor universal health care. It would probably make many things a lot easier. But the grass is not always greener, and having diabetes will always suck.  If you think prices are an issue, can you imagine what it'll be like when there's inevitably a supply chain issue for insulin?  We all be dead. :)"
courdeloofa,2022-05-12,2,OMG so true!
spaketto,2022-05-12,1,"But the only reason you haven't had to pay is because you had good private insurance.  

You shouldn't have to rely on good, for-profit-insurance in order to get your medical needs met.  It is a disgrace that these things are not covered by the government, especially when such a huge proportion of people are not able to get their basic care-needs met.  

I have never had to pay full price for my own pump either (on #5 in 22 years), first because I was covered under my dad's very good plan, and then because I was able to request that my workplace get insurance that covers pumps and CGM's.  I consider myself extremely lucky and privileged, because I'm the exception to the rule and I know it.  My Province does not cover any CGM or pumps or supplies for me and it disgusts me."
SCorpus1980,2022-05-12,1,You're assuming a lot. Typical for someone looking down on U.S. health care.  When I didn't have good medical insurance I had free health care provided by the government. It is called Medicaid and it was even better than having private insurance because I got my insulin pump (and all my other supplies) absolutely free of charge.
spaketto,2022-05-13,1,"But don't you think it's a problem that you have to be at either end of that spectrum to access the healthcare you need?  Not everyone can get access to Medicaid, and not everyone can get the insurance they need through work.  What about all of those people left out in the middle?  The same thing happens in Canada too and I absolutely think it's disgraceful.

And if you found Medicaid was better than your insurance, why would you not want that to be the standard for all?  Canada is in a sorry state too, but there is currently hope with two of our big political parties working together towards Universal Pharmacare (currently its by the Provinces individually).

Now that you have this, you are ready to buy the insulin. 

Assuming you have some kind of private plan, you could be paying full costs until you reach a deductible, then a percentage of those costs until you reach an out of pocket max, and then after paying $10,000 or so in the hole (if insuring a family and excluding your premiums of course), you finally get free health care (except premiums).

p001b0y,2022-05-12,10,"Or nuance can come off as tone deafness depending upon the context of the thread. I was trying to give you the benefit of the doubt. The problem is the profit motive and the need to consistently show higher profits drives costs higher stretching the limits of what a private or public funded source can do. The even larger problem is that there isnt a viable alternative to these models because there are too many components that could be managed well. 

If you are in the US though and not getting paid under the table, you are already funding a single payer system called Medicare. That is 1.45% of your pay. You may not benefit from that system but your parents and/or grandparents may and that 1.45% is likely less that what you are paying in premiums alone in your employer provided plan if you have one. Medicare enrollees can opt into privately run services that add value on top of what Medicare provides like Medicare Advantage. I *think* our friends in Canada may have something similar? Im not sure but Albertans or any other type 1 diabetic having to switch away from the pump and go back to needles and two types of insulin is more than an inconvenience. Its also a failure of the larger system and not just the insurance provider whether it be single payer or not.

I can't choose not to use healthcare and still survive. If there isn't a choice to not use the product then I can't fight a monopoly with too high prices, because there is no other option and I must give them my money.

The colossal failure of yours to understand what I said is present in this one statement. I can't not buy healthcare if I want to live. I don't have that choice. Similarly *someone* innovating some cheaper or better healthcare is not practical. It takes years and resources beyond what a single person or a small group of innovators has available in order to innovate healthcare or medication. It is just not reality.

That's what you said. You also said

&gt; Some areas have public hospitals that wont turn anyone away&.Virtually every hospital in America offers care for indigent.

Two questions for you.

1. Do you think private hospitals would offer care for the indigent if government regulation didn't require it?

2. Do you want government regulation out of our lives so the market can set prices, or do you want hospitals to be required to care for the indigent through regulation? You can't have both. So either your original statement is wrong and based on flawed thinking, or your statements above aren't based in reality. Which is it?

And finally, emergency hospital care **is not the same thing** as preventative care. Nor is it the same as care for chronic and life-long conditions. Should people with those ailments just die because they're in the ""bottom""?

&gt; I understand that what I say seems cold but I know it to be best system

Cold or not, I don't care. What you have said is so far removed from the reality that we're living in. Let the invisible hand of the market deal with and resolve issues of basic human nature? It doesn't work. The market rewards greed; it does not reward collective good. I'm convinced no amount of reasoning, examples, or real-life situations will get through to you and people like you. So, from the bottom of my heart, fuck you and those who think like you. You, those like you who came before and those who will come after, are the bane of society.

4thshift,2022-05-19,84,"This chart is totally inaccurate at best. Governments do not keep good statistics on Type 1 diabetes anywhere. Saudi Arabia is not even part of the data and by most accounts, Type 1 diabetes is relatively prevalent there. Even in the United States, there is no reliable government data available that divides diabetes by Types. It is just crude estimates of incidences at best. Dont believe this map. I saw it long ago when I was doing research for a paper. 

There are good questions to ask, such as why is Scandanavia allegedly so high, but right next door in Russia, the incidences are so low? Is it a genetic clustering effect? Is it about lack of sun exposure or a dietary issue, is it about excess sanitation, or do some countries just do better record keeping and testing than others?  that kind of thing, but the numbers claimed here are in no way accurate. So, conclusions based on a map like this are not possible beyond wild hypotheses. 

And if you read their reports section on T1D, the various hypotheses that they mention, based on tidbits of datapoints, can serve as a spark for imagined extrapolations, but an overall conclusion of the heterogeneity (even with this limited data set) again leads to nothing more than: probably genetics + environment, cant really tell, it depends.

The highest incidence rate category on the map is only &gt; 20 per 100,000 or 0.02%. of the population. (Separately they have a data chart which includes prevalence of certain T1D-associated markers at 150-250 per 100,000  0.15-0.25%.)

This report claims in Saudi Arabia, incidences are epidemic at 1 per 300 or 0.33% which would make Saudi Arabia solidly red.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5964576

This CDC report says 1.6 million adults alone reported being Type 1 in 2019. So, of 328 million people works out to be 0.49%, which again would put the USA in the red category, not orange, and that doesn't include children, which is at least another 244K.

Beyond that, if the average population of the US was like 300,000,000 in their study time period, and prevalence was only 12.2 per 10,000 & that equals only 366,000 Type 1 diabetics in America. And as noted earlier, US Centers for Disease Control clearly estimates nearly 1.9 million T1D patients using insulin. 

Thats a 5-fold disparity  so huge as to be laughably irrelevant, one way or the other. Believe what you want with these studies."
BigHairyDingo,2022-05-19,2,"&gt; There are good questions to ask, such as why is Scandanavia allegedly so high, but right next door in Russia, the incidences are so low? Is it a genetic clustering effect? Is it about lack of sun exposure or a dietary issue, is it about excess sanitation, or do some countries just do better record keeping and testing than others?

Vaccines.

random_guy_8735,2022-05-20,2,"&gt;This chart is totally inaccurate at best. Governments do not keep good statistics on Type 1 diabetes anywhere.

Restoring my earlier comment that got deleted accidentially.  (see the deleted comment for the rest of the thread)

I have spent the last two months trying to get this data for New Zealand.  At a national level the Ministry of Health does not keep a count of T1s.  They do have an estimate of all diabetics in the country (excluding gestational diabetics) but the data is so bad it is laughable, had a baby in the last year you are counted as gestational diabetes are removed even if you have been on insulin for the last 20 years.

I managed to get data for 40% of the population from the soon to be disbanded District Health Boards.  One of the larger health boards provided the best number that they could find and then said they thought it only included 20-40% of the actual number.

The three health boards in Auckland (the largest city in NZ) could only provide me a count for those under 16 and that had twice as many people as the Ministry total.  There are other oddities in that data around the total numbers and rate of new diagnoses, but I will leave you with the understanding that the health system has...

When I ask the health board  that covers where I lived for the total number of T1s they serve they replied that ""pediatric services in our area are provided by the XXX health board"", leaving me, someone diagnosed in middle age, confused as to what they thought they were treating me for.

The best figures I can give for New Zealand is somewhere in the range of 0.30 - 0.38%, but the southern most region is reporting 0.77%."

*Irrelevant because it is from an unrelated source"
4thshift,2022-05-19,10,"How is Saudi Arabia irrelevant? Because its data points directly contradict the notion what some conclude based on visual analysis alone  that it has to do with latitude? 

CDC data estimates incidences of US T1D at nearly 500 per 100,000 but the data provided for this chart lists prevalence of T1D markers in North America at only 150-250 per 100,000,

Phaazoid,2022-05-19,12,Moved to Japan recently.  Nobody knows wtf it is over here.  Big hospitals have like a single pump user for the entire city.  And you have to rent pumps.  It's been not great.
mx_ich_,2022-05-19,6,You rent the pump?? For what purpose? So you can give it back once you're done with having Diabetes?
i-d-even-k-,2022-05-19,2,"It's how it is in Romania as well - you rent the pump out, meaning they give it to you but gov still owns it, so they pay for it and you just have to take good care of it and not lose it and it is free."

i-d-even-k-,2022-05-19,2,"No idea, and definitely not going to fuck around and find out."
wallawalla_,2022-05-19,2,"Sounds like part of their national medicine system. The state owns the pump and rents it out to diabetics. That way, people don't need the $4-5k laying around like they do with insurance here in the US."
bling_bling2000,2022-05-19,1,"If someone pays 4-5k for a pump, then they just bought a pump without insurance from the source.

wallawalla_,2022-05-19,2,"my bad, meant to say 4-6k without insurance. Typically insured folks pay 1/3 to 1/2 of that upfront with insurance covering the rest. 

Depending on the monthly rental cost, it might make more sense to rent."
bling_bling2000,2022-05-19,2,"Gotcha, that makes more sense. I'm curious what the rent payment would be per month. If I pay 1k-3k, that is pretty reasonable to save up for if possible. If not, it could be financed for a monthly fee. If you can do so at a lower or comparable rate versus renting, I would pick the option that ends in payment stopping and I own the device that is keeping me alive in a heart beat. But hey if the payments are tiny then great I suppose"
Phaazoid,2022-05-19,1,"I'm paying like 150$ a month in medical fees, between the insulin, pump supplies, thyroid meds, and the pump rental.  I think at least 2/3s of that is the pump rental costs."
wallawalla_,2022-05-20,1,"Thanks for the extra details. Paid 50% of the cost of my pump upfront. Comes with a four year warranty, so I'm paying about 50 bucks per month if I hadn't paid immediately.

Pump supplies and insulin is another 120 per month."
Phaazoid,2022-05-20,2,"I was paying a lot more for the pump supplies/insulin in the states, and I think my overall costs are down, but the fact that I have to rent the pump when I already have one is a bit of an insult."
Phaazoid,2022-05-19,1,"It's even worse than it sounds.... 

I already had a minimed 670g when I moved over here.  They have the supplies for that pump here. But that pump specifically breaks the country's radio wave laws when communicating with a cgms, so the pump isn't approved by the government.  So the hospital couldn't give me the supplies I needed unless I rented a pump from them.  So I now have a 770g from them that I'm paying like 100$ a month for that just sits on my dresser unused...  Stupidest part is I don't even use a cgms."

Phaazoid,2022-05-20,1,"I know that pump availability is fairly shitty (the biggest hospital in my smaller town only had minimed available), but I can't speak to specifics.  I'm in contact with a few other diabetics over here, and from what I've gathered every situation is gonna be different.  You won't die, but worst comes to worst you'll be paying more than you want to for a brand you don't get a choice on.  They won't like, confiscate what you already have, so if you have a way to get a continuous or large supply of your meds over when you come, that may be the easiest option.

DovBerele,2022-05-19,54,I wonder how this tracks with other autoimmune diseases.  Maybe autoimmunity in general clusters in regions?
ew73,2022-05-19,53,"You have to be REAL careful with this sort of data.  

Are these clusters because there's an actual cluster, or are these countries just better at tracking and reporting incidents of T1? 

Sort of like the whole autism thing.  There's a huge upswing in diagnosis of people on the spectrum.  Is that because there are people on the spectrum or because a sudden expansion in what is considered ""on the spectrum""?"

wallawalla_,2022-05-19,6,"I'll have to dig it up, but there is strong statistical evidence linking vitamin d exposure to pregnant women and the subsequent risk of t1 or other autoimmune diseases in their babies. I think the study was from a decade ago."
emilbirb,2022-05-19,6,"if anything, the diagnostic criteria for the autism
spectrum umbrella has made it so many people who previously had a diagnosis for a sub-type, now no longer meet the criteria for a diagnosis at all. so i wouldnt say there has been an expansion of what it means to be on the spectrum, but rather a restriction.

what HAS happened is that people are starting to learn more about different ways autism can present itself, and that many of us dont act stereotypically autistic at all. on top of that, we now know that generally autism presents differently in women than in men, and so infinite amounts of women in their 30s 40s 50s 60s are only now getting diagnosed after suffering in silence their whole lives.

i dont know that that is an accurate comparison to t1 diabetes, which is not really a disability where you can act like youre not diabetic and still survive. my boyfriend got his t1 diagnosis when he was 16, cos you drop dead if you dont. i got my autism diagnosis after 28 years. i dont think its a fair comparison to make for either side."
ew73,2022-05-19,3,"While I freely admit I am wrong re: diagnosis itself, the underlying point, and the point I'm trying to convey is one of reporting and data integrity.

&gt;  we now know that generally autism presents differently in women than in men, and so infinite amounts of women in their 30s 40s 50s 60s are only now getting diagnosed after suffering in silence their whole lives.

If you simply looked at ""number of new diagnoses"" and saw a huge jump in say, the US, but not say, Russia, is that because spectrum conditions are more common in the US, or because Russian medicine hasn't caught up to the US in terms of diagnosing older women?  

Thus my warning about simply looking at the sorts of data in the OP's post and drawing causal links from it."
theatreshmeatre,2022-05-19,1,"I did a paper on the autism subject not too long ago. A while ago, it was believed that Autism was a ""rich person's disease"" (their words, not mine) and it wasn't until recently when they did a new study that they found the the reason the data has that conclusion is because the other groups don't have access to doctors to give them a proper diagnosis, so it was the textbook definition of statistical bias. it's a really interesting subject if you ever find yourself looking to learn something new. it's really great that we have researchers who are just as interested in ""how can we help?"" as they are ""why is this happening?"""

Good point, if you can't access insulin and die of DKA (shudder) then you will never grow the population beyond those diagnosed in the last few months (and the rich who can source it).  The South Island of New Zealand (coloured red on the map) has at least 1 T1 who is in their late 90s."

The greater-burdened areas all, for the most part, have better medical care than the uncolored areas.

Many adult T1's, to this day, are incorrectly diagnosed as T2.  I'd bet once medical care around the world gets on the same page and does antibody tests at diagnosis, the colors will even out a bit."

pheregas,2022-05-20,1,"Very much so in adults.  Many docs have the preconception that T1s are only diagnosed as children.

T1s as adults tend to have a slower advance of the disease with a longer honeymoon period. Many adult-diagnosed T1s are even put on metformin.

The underlying factor here is testing for antibodies. Until this is done, nobody really knows for sure if its 1 or 2.

And many adults are treated with metformin until their pancreas finally stops working and end up in DKA. 

IMHO the antibody tests should be given to all people presenting with diabetes from an elevated A1c."

WeekendLazy,2022-05-19,-4,Im pretty sure its caused by obesity only like 80% of the time.
DovBerele,2022-05-19,1,Most fat people (and even more true for the absolute fattest people) don't have diabetes.  It's far more likely that the same metabolic/genetic preconditions that make one vulnerable to t2 diabetes also cause obesity.
Creepydoe,2022-05-19,1,Where does this data come from? because there are statistics about Slovak T1D and T2D (and it's quite similar to Czech numbers)
Obono,2022-05-19,1,As a Scot I am surprised we and northern Ireland have higher rates than  England.
pumaofshadow,2022-05-19,2,A lot of my T1 English friends who got it later in life were told for years its type 2 so there are uncounted cases out there most likely. I don't know if Scottish healthcare also is better at testing and closer diagnosis.
pennybeagle,2022-05-19,1,I wonder if Canada and Europes universal healthcare systems have anything to do with the high incidence there. Not sure if whatever survey this is from includes only new cases or just general morbidity.

WoefulHC,2022-05-03,4,"Like many things this is very much a ""Your Diabetes May Vary"". For me, it is largely based on whether the dopamine rush of eating that food item, combined with the social context, my current blood glucose, insulin on board and energy levels make me want to determine (guess) the number of carbs and their duration in order to appropriately dose for the item. Most of the time pizza is something I'll dose for and eat. However there are times (or styles or topping combos) where it definitely falls into my garbohydrates list. 

Other things on the list for me:

* Peanut butter cookies. 
* Most baked goods that had already roasted nuts added before baking. (This is largely a texture thing for me)
* Butterscotch in most cases
* Mint chocolate chip ice cream (has about a 70% chance of falling in this for me.)
* Ice cream sundae (in most cases)
* Banana split"

Something about the oats&?

Portion control is definitely key. My RD pleaded with me not to go keto or try to go ultra low carb. Keeping it around 60g-70 carbs per meal and 20g per snack seems to work for me."

With rice in particular, I often get low about an hour after the meal and then have a massive spike 4-5 hours after that, just too much of a headache to deal with. Having said that, I have similar issues with pizza but I consider pizza worth it ;-)"

The fruit Juice I used to pound like no bodies business  
Fruitsnacks (like the bar kind)   
and the Honey I used to take in my daily pot of tea.  


I used to have somewhere in the realm of 2tbsp of honey per 6 cups of tea and drink between 6 and 12 cups per day.  


Carb heavy things I just couldn't not eat  
Pasta (Reduced portion size)  
Popcorn (Cut portion by 3/4 from 16 cups popped (1/2 cup unpopped) to 1/8 cup Unpopped 4 cups poppped then increased back to 8 cups popped 1/4 cup unpopped after finding the other too small as a test and found it didn't seem to negatively impact me at that level)  
Toast (Reduced portion size and cut out sweet toppings)  


Before diagnosis a given day would be around 4000 callories of food with about 300-400g of carbs, little to no exercise, and would usually contain 1-2 pots of black tea with 2tbsps of honey in each and 16 cups of popped popcorn before bed or at lunch on night shift.  


Now I'm tracking everything I eat (I haven't started measuring my blood sugar yet I will admit) and eating far less (Usually Sub 2000 calories) and I added 4km of walking per day (Only missed ONE DAY since diagnosis) I'm down 30lbs and feeling better than ever with all the diabetic symptoms I was having gone away"

jon4jay,2022-05-18,11,I like it. But anyone I squirt with a unit or two hates the smell!
BabyRinseCycle,2022-05-19,4,lol youre menace running around shooting people with insulin
jon4jay,2022-05-19,3,>#># been doing it since 12 when I was diagnosed. My dad has been spraying me with his 12 years prior -- the apple doesn't fall far from the tree haha
unsharpenedpoint,2022-05-19,-4,"There are diabetics in the US DYING without insulin, finish your insulin. Dont go squirting it around like a super soaker.

Oh my gosh, this was a joke! Im sorry"
jon4jay,2022-05-19,5,"For starters, I actually donate my insulin quite often to people who cannot afford it. In fact, 3 months ago I gave 40 levemir pens to someone whos daughters insurance wouldn't cover her suddenly and she had no insulin.

Secondly, I pay for my insulin, and have been a type 1 diabetic for 25 years. It's not my fault people are dying without insulin. 

Lastly, you do realize you're supposed to prime an insulin pen before each shot to get the air out and generally you lose 1-2 units of insulin.

So calm down over there before I spray you with some humalog.

Please keep your unwarranted, judgemental comments to your self thank you."
unsharpenedpoint,2022-05-19,3,"Im sorry, this was a joke. It was supposed to be a riff on kids are starving so eat your peas sort of thing. I thought it came off as a joke but forgot the /s 

And yes, I know you have to prime it. Thats how I know the smell. 

I tend to joke about my medical issues. I recently had to have two organ transplants and joking helps me cope. 

I didnt mean to offend, we are all in this together."
jon4jay,2022-05-19,1,"Omg lmao if that really was a joke than I apologize for my response!

 But come on, this is the internet, specifically reddit.. your comment was way too similiar to a typical response to someone these days! Maybe put a smiley face after it next time haha"
unsharpenedpoint,2022-05-19,2,"It was such a joke! Lol. Yeah, it needed an /s on it. Spraying insulin like a super soaker just tickled me. I was over tired and sick. But the thought!

No need to apologize. I also grew up where The Onion used to distribute paper copies so my sense of humor may be (is) warped."
jon4jay,2022-05-19,2,># I un-downvoted you. Were cool. Your sense of humor can't be more warped than mine! Haha
unsharpenedpoint,2022-05-19,2,"Haha, thanks! This disease is so hard. Ive learned to cope with medical stuff with humor. 

I was in the ICU for a couple months on a feeding tube and they checked my blood sugar every hour, 24/7.  Apparently they dont have blood sugar friendly feeds. I apologized to a doc because I couldnt get much sleep and he said youre here to get better, not to sleep. My nurse aide said that to me every hour after that and it made it so much better ># if it werent for her, Id probably still be pissed at that lol. 

After the ICU I got two organ transplants. I bought a bikini for this year and plan to tell anyone that stares that its just a shark bite, no big deal. >"

Girlygabenpepe,2022-05-18,3,I don't and the kidss at my school used to tell me I stink of it in a sad attempt to bully me.

whoisearth,2022-05-01,29,NO!!!!!!!!
Ravinder20,2022-05-01,9,Oh haha sorry I don't really know what I'm meant to be eating atm
whoisearth,2022-05-01,10,You can eat anything just make sure you're bolusing correctly with your insulin.  Your endo is your new best friend.
Ravinder20,2022-05-01,5,"Yeah ill get used to it hopefully, stupid question what's an endo?"
whoisearth,2022-05-01,10,"endocrinologist.  If you're T1D you should have one.  Basically it's a specialized doctor in diabetes.  They should be going over important things with you like diet changes, bolus calculators and checking your A1C (long term insulin numbers).

Being Hypo (low) or Hyper (high) glycemic is bad for your body and can lead to some bad shit up to and including death."
Ravinder20,2022-05-01,8,Oh right I've just been assigned a community diabetes nurse as far as I know ill ask her about it next week. Thanks for the info feel like I'm learning more here than at the docs
whoisearth,2022-05-01,15,"Just remember barring medical breakthroughs it's not curable.  Anyone who tries to tell you ""just eat xyz and you'll no longer need insulin"" is a destructive asshole.

From now until you die or you're cured you need insulin to manage your BS.  Usually you will be prescribed two.  Humalog and Lantus.  Lantus is a slow acting insulin you usually take once a day to help avoid the peaks and valleys.  Humalog is your bolus you take before meals or during corrections.

Your diabetes journey will be similar but unique to everyone elses.  Your body will react to food completely different.

As an example, pizza is well known in the diabetic community as being a shit show to correctly bolus for.  My son who is T1D is perfectly fine with pizza.  Syrup on the other hand is the devils nectar which no matter how much insulin he has he's still going to go high.

I'll also recommend /r/diabetes_t1 because despite both being diabetes you will get better responses there simply because t1d is different and the members have a different overall mindset."
Ravinder20,2022-05-01,11,"Yeah I ate a pizza 2 days after I got my libre and had a terrible time think ill avoid for now. At the minute it seems no matter what I eat my BS shoots right up. I'm sure I'll find what works for me. Again I really genuinely appreciate the advise, I have virtually no one to help me and have only really had a couple quick chats to nurses so all this info is invaluable atm"
JTAD1138,2022-05-01,3,"Me hearing this a year and a half into being T1D having only gone to the family doc thus far. *concern*

I am planning to go to one soon though"
Smerks101,2022-05-02,2,"&gt;endocrinologist.  If you're T1D you should have one. 

Is there less/no need for T2 to see one? Im new to this and recently diagnosed by a terrible PCP that Im currently changing so Im curious to know if I should push my new PCP to put me with one."
NewfieDawg,2022-05-02,3,"If you are T2D, your body is still making some insulin, but it is not as much as you need nor effective on it's own. It would not hurt to see an endo or to find an Internist that is certified as a Diabetic Educator. But of the two, the endo is the most likely to be of help for your T2. FWIW, I was disgnosed with T2 18 years ago."
Munchkinjj,2022-05-01,4,"endocrinologist - no stupid questions, and even if they were, ask whatever you need from whomever you need to get your answers."
Evenoh,2022-05-01,6,"Its a long time joke that cinnamon cures diabetes. It does not. There is evidence that cinnamon will very slightly improve insulin sensitivity in the short term. Anybody with insulin resistance (type 2 but type 1 can develop this too) can have a very, very tiny benefit. And thats it. I like to think of it this way: if I *want* something that cinnamon goes well with, then I opt for adding cinnamon. Since youre a new type 1, the chances this can provide you with any sort of benefit any time soon are pretty much zero. 

Until you learn what works for you, just try to eat as low carb as you can without depressing yourself and slowly returning to a normal amount of carbs. Itll take a while no matter what to start to get those wild highs down. Hope it smooths out soon, it must be quite unpleasant to deal with that right now."
Ravinder20,2022-05-01,6,Thanks for the advice I'll cancel my order of cinnamon sticks then haha
DogadonsLavapool,2022-05-02,2,"Haha the cinnamon thing is a meme. Shitty Dr. Oz types hyped it up as a way to reduce type II diabetics blood sugar (which is bs), but then of course people started telling us type Is about it too.

As for food, early on just stick to lower carb stuff if you can. Chicken is great, tofu if you're veg. Vegetables and fruit are good as well. I personally love to snack on sunflower seeds. Do try your absolute best to remember to cover it before you eat. 

You still get to have a life with food, especially when your pancreas finally goes bye bye and everything becomes more consistent. The myth that diabetics have to eat the purest of food is bs. It's highly recommended to look into pump therapy after honeymoon phase too - personally, I think the tslim/dexcom pairing is an absolute game changer. 

Your main enemies food wise are pizza and anything super sugary. Good luck :)"

p0ggs,2022-05-01,2,"It will happen, for sure... Have your diabetes team explained the symptoms? It's a very distinct feeling; I think you'll know it when it happens. It can be scary but try not to panic, and try to always have a pack of glucose tabs on you - they kick in very quickly and are easy to keep in a bag or pocket. If you get caught without anything sugary on you, try to get to a shop to buy something... full-sugar drinks (coke, sprite, OJ, etc) tend to work quicker than edible items, but jelly babies, fruit pastilles type sweets can be quite effective too."

You fucking got this my dude, don't let it get you down because it WILL get you down and it WILL burn you out, but keep your head up because it won't be easy, and you're gonna hear some stupid shit from people who don't know a damn thing about type 1 or diabetes in general but just be the bigger person, educate and live your life as healthy as you can. I have kidney disease, Gastroparesis, anemia, a shitty a1c, I've been in DKA hundreds and hundreds of times and my body is ruined and I'm only 25 so please please please take this seriously, I'm not trying to use scare tactics, but just giving some insight as to just how quickly not caring can hit you.

crappysurfer,2022-05-02,2,"Staying around 400 for at least 5 hours in dangerous and ketones/ketoacidosis zone. 

Yes, honeymoon is erratic, but staying *that* high all day????"
DogadonsLavapool,2022-05-02,2,I'm more saying that talking about shredding your kidneys and your eyes by being high for a few hours in honeymoon is too far. That takes years of abuse. Dka is definitely a big worry tho - no disagreements there.
Ravinder20,2022-05-01,1,"That's the plan, my nurse told me to only take 3 units of insulin before meals so it's quite difficult atm"
crappysurfer,2022-05-01,3,Thats not right. You need an endocrinologist and to develop an insulin to carbohydrate ratio and count carbs. Mine is generally 1 unit per 10 carbs. 3 units would cover 30g which is something like 8oz of orange juice.
Ravinder20,2022-05-01,1,"Yeah thats will be what I'll do eventually, but she said I'll need to build it up slowly or I'll suffer from dropping my blood sugar to quickly"
crappysurfer,2022-05-01,4,I think you need a second opinion because this is potentially dangerous
CadoAngelus,2022-05-02,1,"The trouble is being newly diabetic the pancreas is still trying to do its job despite doing it badly, and it wll get a second wind before eventually stopping producing insulin. Until then, the nurse will be trying to bring his BG down strategically to avoid sudden onset hypos, so high BG is fairly common.

Agreed OP should talk with nurse/endo, but this is fairly common newly diagnosed strategy."
LtFarian,2022-05-01,3,"Seconding the other commenter's concerns, that sounds really strange. In my 6+ years of being type 1 I've never heard of something like that. Please get a second opinion from someone who knows their stuff about t1 diabetes"

Quack_Mac,2022-05-01,1,My digital scale greets me with HI when I turn it on. Never fails to give me a moment of panic.
Simen-VH,2022-05-02,1,HI! im just here to remind you're fucked
milanico2309,2022-05-02,1,"Highs do more damage to you then lows, when in doubt do more insulin. You reaaaaaally shouldnt stay up there that long.

- Drink a lot of water
- Dont do any physical activity
- Dont eat anything, some diabetics get really hungry when high, dont eat!!!
- Do ketone tests and apply schema B if your doc gave you one.
- Check if your Pump and/or insertion set and insulin are good, when in doubt change things.

You have a health bar, its depleating whenever your BG is high. When it reaches 0, your body starts to break down. Possible consequences include:

Early:
- Loss of eyesight
- Erectile dysfunction
- Reduced bowl-functionality
- Loss of tactile senses.

Later:
- Loss of kidneys
- Loss of lower limbs

You can avoid all of thoose&"
Significant_Ad_9712,2022-05-02,1,Since u just got diagnosed ur A1C is v high which is dangerous so try lowering it for now thats what i was told so for the first three months i was on a plant based diet (i ate carbs like once a month) it was a v strict diet but it helped my a1c drop from 15.2 to 7.6 whoch is rlly good so try doing that but if u wanna eat then u need to hit insulin (always wait two hours after u eat to check ur blood sugar levels so u dont correct and get hypos)

streetsintel,2022-05-01,-1,"Kindly, Show me the updated viewpoint please"
NotSelfAware,2022-05-01,5,That you can develop T1 diabetes at any age. It has no relationship to age whatsoever.

ukkohertell,2022-05-01,10,"Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed before the age of 25, but can be diagnosed up until the age of 40. If you put it simply, type 1 diabetes is when your pancreas stops producing sufficient insulin and type 2 is when your body cannot use it efficiently. There are also many other types of diabetes that may or may not relate to your lifestyle.

I am no medical professional, but I know that what you're saying is not true. Please stop sharing false information.

I am not saying, that one shouldn't get things tested by a medical professional if they have any doubts!"
LibraryGoddess,2022-05-01,3,"That's interesting. I'm recently diagnosed, and assumed it has to be type 2 because I'm over 50, but I also was just treated for non-Hodgkins lymphoma, some of which affected my pancreas, which my primary care provider says is what's the likely cause of my diabetes. It's still most probably type 2, but it's worth asking about at my next appointment."
streetsintel,2022-05-01,-1,What false information i shared? Can you elaborate please so we can have a discussion
Munchkinjj,2022-05-01,5,"saying that you wont get type 1 as an adult and assuming you can read OP better than his healthcare professional through a computer screen is a good start. i get you're a super smart big brain pharmacist, but idk if you can say all of that with like two data points (age and OP's blood sugar for past two hours)"
ukkohertell,2022-05-01,2,"""Well , t1 occur for young kids at their beginning""
Not necessarily. Type 1 diabetes can occur at an older age too.

 ""but t2 occur when pancreas can't synthesis adequate insulin or u have insulin resistance or any underlying cause""
Type 2 diabetes is usually when your body can't use the insulin the pancreas produces (insulin resistance).

""so according to your age you might have t2 check ur endocrinologist with the important test of RPG,FPG,A1C""
Not necessarily. Reasons stated previously.

You cannot just look at a person's age and tell them what kind of diabetes they've got. There is not enough information in this post for you to diagnose them."

svedka666,2022-05-26,7,"I'm sure a laser removal or cover up would be a pretty insignificant thing in comparison if a cure actually ended up existing. 


Unfortunately, I highly doubt that's ever going to happen. Imagine how much money pharmaceutical companies would lose if we didn't need insulin anymore."
toproflcopter,2022-05-26,2,"Honestly man Im skeptical too having been T1D for ~15 years, but at the same time, there is so much money in disruptive medicine right now.

Companies like Vertex would make tens of billions if not hundreds of billions if their therapy succeeds. Honestly, the possible profit in curing it is the only thing that gives me hope itll actually happen"
svedka666,2022-05-26,3,"That is a good point, I just wonder if it would still be profitable long-term. It seems like it would be much better on their end to keep making diabetics buy insulin, test strips, everything else needed for their whole life rather than one (obviously more costly) procedure to just fix it. Of course I hope a cure exists in the future, I just don't know if I can be optimistic on it."
toproflcopter,2022-05-26,5,"It wouldnt be profitable for companies like Novo Nordisk and Eli Lily, but thankfully theres plenty of other companies that arent in the treatment market, but know they can make a shit ton of money over cures.

It helps that so many people have T1D, its the most common chronic autoimmune disease. Anyone that cures it and sells the cure for even 50k per person will be unfathomably rich.

Nowadays I think a cure is (probably) coming soon but I just wonder about its affordability and accessibility. The company that cures it will want to squeeze as much money out of people and I live in the US man, my insurance aint covering shit"
ClayWheelGirl,2022-05-26,1,"Sorta kinda like Hep C. a $1000 a pill n i think u need one everyday for 6 months to a year = $94,000

thecoletrane,2022-05-25,3,"Eh I know its not an official medical alert but as these are getting more common more Emergency responders notice them in place of bracelets or necklaces. Not to mention my pump and cgm would be a big clue.

igotzthesugah,2022-04-26,59,"There are thoughts of extracting insulin from livestock as was done in WWII.  Its certainly possible though my own thoughts are that its unlikely as it requires a level of resources that I dont believe will exist and a level of calm that is unlikely to exist until well after were all dead.  Occupied Shanghai during wartime is different than a post apocalyptic wasteland.  

Short term disruption we ride it out with what we have until services return.  Long term we die.  We can choose wasting away while taking an unfair share of limited resources or going out in a blaze of glory.  Ill be the guy with a box of twinkies in one hand and an AK in the other."

But if there is ever a global collapse, then 5% of the world's diabetic population dying from lack of insulin is going to be fairly minor on the list of concerns.

More realistically is a local disaster. Local disasters (outside of war) tend to last days or weeks not months or years, before you can get to a pharmacy. Having a supply on hand and an evacuation plan is what I go with."
mystisai,2022-04-26,12,"Also if anyone wants tips, I do enjoy sharing my evacuation plans with fellow diabetics. I do not have a lot of answers, but I have a few."

mystisai,2022-04-26,19,"Figure out what disasters are most common in your area. Mine is wildfires and earthquakes. How your area responds to disasters plays a big part too. I have red cross near by.

Insulins are kept in an insulated lunch bag in the fridge door. This makes it easy to grab during an evacuation. It also makes it slightly more immune to smaller incidences like power outages. 

I am prescribed more insulin than I use. This allows me to build a small stockpile. I also have printouts with my current prescription information, so I can show it to a pharmacy wherever I evacuate to. 

Each person in my house has a backpack *already packed* that includes 2 changes of clothes, first aid kit, mylar blanket, and 2 days worth of food and water. Plus a way to boil water or start a fire. My bag is also stocked with needle tips, (2) libre 2 sensors, test strips  with the reader, and a rechargeable battery pack. My husband and mother also take long term medications that are easily stored in their kits.

My car trunk also has a 3 day emergency kit of food, water, and a backpacking stove with fuel. I also printed driving directions to family, and hospital systems along the way. All of this is stored in a way we could leave on foot if necessary.

Because damage to my home is most likely event to cause evacuations, my kit also has copies of documents that show my address, birth certs etc."
jonnnnnnn1,2022-04-26,6,"This is amazing. Once you see a wildfire up close in person you will never be the same. Easily the scariest thing Ive ever seen in my life. When they say that seconds count, it is literal seconds that could make all the difference. 

I know some people that live in wildfire areas and half the year they literally have to keep everything important to them in a container in the garage right next to the car. Its no joke.

In my kit I keep things like peanut butter, ready rice, canned chicken, tuna, spam, mashed potato flakes, oatmeal. Basically anything that can be heated in boiling water sous vide, made by adding boiling water, or eaten cold. Peanut butter (or any nut butter) is good because its proteins fats and carbs, and can be eaten with a spoon, plus my kid likes it."

When setting up my first bug-out kit, I asked my insurance agent whether photocopies of my policies were OK or would the originals be required. His answer was that copies were fine, but even those weren't necessary as long as I had the policy NUMBERS.

I mean I know how to survive in the wild with nothing more than a knife. Hunt, fish, trap. Make fire, make shelter etc.

Rhian713,2022-04-27,2,"I have had a lot of time to think about this and it depends on how much society collapses. There is a difference between an apocalypse on the order of a natural disaster where you know everything is awful but eventually, things will get better, versus a world-altering event that leaves few people left and stuck in the bronze age again.

Assuming the latter, without a degree in biochem and a clean lab to produce insulin, you would be very fucked long term. Even insulin acquired from animals is impure and would need some kind of treatment before you could make effective use out of it. 

Best thing to do is learn a very important and useful skill. Mine happens to be knowing how to make extremely basic penicillin, which will also be in high demand assuming antibiotics still work. I would trade for insulin and other necessities as long as I could, teach as many people as I could everything I knew, then when supplies to keep me alive ran out or became scarce, I would make my peace and not be a burden to my fellow survivors."

They make you bloated, slow down the digestion, not hydrating the body properly and you can digest later causing GC to spike as well as not ""poop"" regularly and having issues emptying stomach. I have over 50 sessions with doctors in past 5 years, am on a strict diet and take ""prokinetics"" medication which help with emptying the stomach and all of the doctors mentioned to stay away from these, I have coke zero from time to time but only with a lot of water and physical excercise after, otherwise it always causes issues for 2 days afterwards for me."

deflatermaus,2022-05-17,1,Coke Zero uses acesulfame potassium (Ace-K) while Diet Coke uses aspartame.  See: https://sugarfreehq.com/what-sweetener-is-in-coke-zero/
Zouden,2022-05-17,2,That is incorrect. Ace-K is always used in combination with aspartame. Coke zero contains both sweeteners.

So maybe something to consider:  Increase your protein at previous meal, and you may find less of a need to snack in between meals. 

Otherwise, most foods, other than pure fat are going to have some minor effect on blood sugar. Even fiber and protein can cause a mild spike if you eat enough, as stimulation of the digestive process releases glucagon."

East-Tumbleweed,2022-05-10,1,Oh really? How so?
silk7866,2022-05-10,5,"It can make you actually go into ketosis, which would make your liver release even more glucose in is what needed. As a diabetic, especially a type one diabetic, your body does need glucose from food."
Lausannea,2022-05-10,9,"If you're in ketosis for a prolonged period of time, your liver actually depletes its glycogen stores and doesn't replenish it easily.

Your body can process proteins into the needed glucose to function.

Keto diets for type 1s are generally more risky because it brings you closer to DKA compared to type 1s who aren't already in ketosis. Doesn't mean it can't be done safely, it just increases the risks of developing DKA faster if you're sick, dehydrated, or otherwise don't have access to insulin."
East-Tumbleweed,2022-05-10,1,"But can't you andjust your bolus to compensate for the extra glucose your liver produces? 

Also, why does your body need glucose from food? For energy? If so, when you're in ketosis, from my understanding your body starts burning ketones for energy. 

If you don't know the answers that's totally fine by the way - I am just interested in and exploring low carb so I'm curious."
silk7866,2022-05-10,1,Youre thinking of ketoacidosis. Ketosis is when your body thinks its fasting. And doing that for a long time can detrimental for some people.
East-Tumbleweed,2022-05-10,4,"I don't think so. I'm pretty sure ketoacidosis is when your body doesn't have enough insulin to use glucose as energy, so it starts to burn fat for ketones in a desperate attempt to create energy. Eventually you end up with too many ketones in your blood and it becomes acidic which is bad for your cardiovascular system. 

So, both produce ketones but for different reasons. In normal ketosis, you replace carbs with fats and your body begins to burn fat for ketones as energy. You lose weight when you don't give it enough fat. As long as you're getting insulin for the carbs (and protein) you do eat, this isn't a problem and ketones should stay in normal range.

Lausannea,2022-05-10,12,"&gt;People dont understand what real Diabetes is.

This is pretty gross. Real diabetes is when the body can't process glucose in a way that allows for good health without a long-term treatment plan. That is true for all 8+ types of diabetes.

Between MODY and type 1, which is the 'real' diabetes? Between 3c and type 2, which is the 'real' diabetes?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And it creates a whole bunch of other issues for those of us who are having to deal with this.

This only makes sense if you think people with type 2 did it to themselves and you're tired of people thinking you did it to yourself with type 1. Both are wrong. Diabetes isn't a competition. We're all in the same boat of having issues metabolizing glucose with insulin, for different reasons through different causes, but with the same end result.

We all die early and preventable deaths if we don't manage our diabetes. Please do better.

That's the thing. They manage it. They don't fix it. It's a long-term treatment plan and type 2 has no cure.

&gt;Type 1 and type 2 are two totally different illnesses and should not be associated with one another. 

I'm well aware they are different illnesses. But they share the same symptoms and largely the same treatment plans too (diet and exercise is part of a type 1 regime, insulin is part of a type 2 regime).

The issue here isn't with the definition of the illnesses and how they're not the same thing. The issue here is with your perception that type 2s are beneath you and your agreement that type 1 is the only 'real' type of diabetes, as per the OP.

About a month before my diagnosis (during the pandemic), things got ridiculously intense at work and I was working 18-hour days Monday through Friday (and 11 hours on Sat/Sun. . . ).  Six months to the day after my father passed I was diagnosed with T1.

AutisticEngineer420,2022-05-03,5,"Yeah, basically my brother and I both got diabetes in our mid/late 20s both in stressful periods of our lives and we both had mental health crises and got diagnosed with T1D (totally independently), even though we have no known family history of T1D. 

However I later learned from my Mom that we both had a virus (coxsackievirus) when we were very young, and this virus is associated with developing T1D. So its possible the immune response was just dormant or acting very slowly at a constant rate in both of us for a fixed amount of time and then we both got T1D around the same time. But I still tend to think that the stress probably was the trigger that made things worse for both of us. And either way once you are diabetic stress has a huge impact on blood sugar."

ayurg,2022-05-03,1,"for type 1. I don't know what could have caused mine. Unlike others I didn't contract any sort of virus in the months or weeks before. My family has no history of type 1 diabetes. I was in ninth grade (14)and didn't face any stress other than typical school stuff. 

The only thing that I can think is that I had really bad asthma as a child and was in the hospital quite a bit before I turned  4.   I was put on steroids to grow/strngthen lungs and some other medicines. (one caused class action suit that won because it made some people even more sick.)

I was thinking that most if not all type 1s I met had some condition or naturally weaker immune system before type 1 (I.e. Getting the flu and cold more often)  

So I was thinking it's a mixture of your own immune system and then being exposed to an environmental factor that most others are able to fight off.      ...but these are all just assumptions based on nothing other than trying to explain how a handful of people I know have it.  This is a theory that I'm likely to change at any point. 

I really wish they could just tell us what we did and if we possibly did something to cause it or could it have been prevented?"
Rsatdcms,2022-05-03,1,"For me a flu was most likely. I spent 3 days in bed before i could go to a pharmacy to get anything remotely useful. Few years later after i was diagnosed the timescales matched up.

Sure-Treacle3934,2022-05-03,1,"I also believe that my autoimmune diseases were triggered by stress. Just before my arthritis symptoms appeared I had a fall that caused a dislocated shoulder and other medication injuries. I feel it was the trigger. 

The diabetes occurred after a horrible experience at a former job. A virus was the last straw and I developed symptoms shortly after. 

Stress or trauma is definitely a trigger for immune issues."

Stress leads to loads of poor lifestyle choices, bad sleep, and a myriad of other issues (like depression and anxiety in my case). I was always ordering food in and I remember thinking, maybe if I just stop getting takeaway all the time, it'll go away. Except it didn't.

Even my doctor is calling this ""unique"" and goes against everything my lifestyle would suggest. I have had a TON of stress over the past year - bought a house, cohabitating, hate my job...went in for physical and blood work last week - BAM glucose level of 400. Weirdest part is I feel totally fine other than some unintended weight loss. I don't think stress would push a spike this high, but this has come out of nowhere. I had Covid 3 weeks ago, been reading that can cause a ""temporary diabetes"", so I am reading up on that.

There is a message that I want to deliver to you.
I completely understand that you may be feeling the way you do now. You also may be blaming on those external conditions/factors in your life. 

First aftermath from these is inevitable in life.
Recently, I learned the Buddhism idea that the second aftermath is caused by oneself. We are doing the harm to ourselves. No need to do that. You have done that enough, as the objective number of such high blood sugar indicates. So Id like to strongly encourage you to be happy nonetheless and love yourself."
joseph4th,2022-05-04,1,"I was diagnosed right after a high stress time, but Im not really someone who feels the effect of stress.

Then I got a new job in a foreign country (Im American and the job was in Australia) shortly after moving there I passed out at work and found out. Ive always theorized that mine had to do with the Atkins diet which my wife and I went on just before we got married. I stopped after the wedding and pigged out on a cruise and at Disneyworld before the move to Australia. Thing is I wasnt really overweight to begin with and she kept losing weight after stopping the diet. 

Now that I wrote it out though, it was a stressful time and there are some stress related things I left out. Though that is not saying that it might not have been stress and the Atkin diet. I do think about it often as diabetes does not run in the family."

Why I am yawning so much?  *pause*  this doesn't feel like a migraine.  Oh wait.  How fast I am dropping?  (and at that point if my alarm hasnt gone off, then I do have double arrows)"
bling_bling2000,2022-05-09,3,"If your most noticeable symptom is yawning when low, you are almost certainly running low too often. There was a period in my life that I started sleeping through my lows and waking up high (my liver would kick in). At one point I started getting super sleepy during the day - like a non-napper suddenly falling asleep on the couch type of sleepy - and gradually figured out that it happened when I was lower than 3.0 but I never felt it or bothered checking. I'd basically sleep through the lows, which is super dangerous.

Basically, run it a little high for a while and keep an eye on sugars you don't or can't typically check. It took a while to expose the night time lows as the source of my lost low sensation but it's always a good place to start, very common problem"

havent gone lower than 74 (not on insulin) but when i hit low 80s i get a little tired.

this is crazy but my highs are exactly the same as after ive done too much coffee. Extreme fatigue, brain fog, blurry vision, drop off to sleep in the middle of conversation, cannot hold a conversation. if i am in the middle of a task my mood changes n i get sooo cranky. sometimes I have to take my blood sugar measurement to know if its sugar talking or coffee talking. If its sugar I go exercise. The higher my heart rate the faster my sugar comes down. Even if I climb stairs continuously for 20 minutes my heart rate goes faster. when I do the elliptical even if I stop a bunch of times in the 30 minute im on it, ive dropped a 120 points in half hour. if its coffee i keep downing water. 

i am scared of my highs because i can shut down anywhere at 150- 160 (u know how easy it is to get to that). esp if im doing a mundane task. in the middle of a lecture, or watching tv. Driving sometimes can be Mundane. many times Ive driven home driving safely but not remembering any of the ride. Specially on regular routes my body drives while my mind is elsewhere.

MadBliss,2022-05-09,1,"It's unfortunately normal to lose the ability to tell highs and lows if you've frequently been all over the place. Some people, not all. Those receptors just don't tell you anything anymore because your body has learned to compensate. Also, it's tough to notice symptoms when you're used to feeling like dog shit all the time.

The shaking may get more severe where you might struggle to open a package or unlock your phone. At this point for me I also get very very sweaty.

I cut all the sweet drinks, cut the honey from my tea, and cut most of my portion sizes way down. I've gone back up somewhat on some things and I have had a few bad days when I went over where I would like to be carb wise but no one is perfect lol.

For example I used to eat 1/2 cup Unpopped (16 cups popped) popcorn at a sitting even after having 3 large meals in my day now I limit my corn habit to maybe once per week if that and I eat only 1/4 cup Unpopped (8 cups popped) or 1/8 cup Unpopped (4 cups popped) depending on what the rest of my day was like."

Pre-bolus with Novolog because pizza crust can hit fast at first.

Novolin R at meal time to cover remaining carbs.

But seriously I can't do pizza without the ""worst case scenario insulin.""

It wasn't until I actually switched to Novolog that I realized why everyone ""hates"" pizza. I would always have a mild rise in blood sugar followed by a flat steady line that was completely uneventful.

So yeah... Hit up your local Walmart and get the ""terrible"" insulin. It's a great temp basal insulin and a great pizza insulin, and a great insulin for square bolusing.

I'm not gonna tell you how much to take, just that it works longer than Novolog and you can add it to your diabetic tools.

Also uh... I clip three different pens to my shirt just so I can eat pizza with a can of Mtn Dew without spiking or crashing."

If I don't want to inject front of someone at a restaurant, say I am out with customers, I will try to find a quiet corner that isn't the bathroom.  unless it is a small restaurant it is usually possible to find something that will block you from view.

I avoid injecting in front of customers because they pay a lot of money for me to provide them with very technical solutions and I don't want unnecessary questions or doubts to enter their heads.

Lausannea,2022-05-25,1,"You're right that your priority is taking care of yourself.

But please let's remember that there are people with hugely disabling needle phobias who can't even see a needle without practically fainting. It's a disability for them because it makes access to healthcare nightmareish for them, and being around a diabetic who injects can be extremely distressing.

They matter too. And you're welcome to offer showing how it works and everything, because you're right, education matters! And some people really don't find it a problem after seeing it a few times.

But needle phobias are terrible and they're real, and we're not beyond being compassionate about how others we care about feel. It's free to tell them to look away for a minute. I tell my sister to look away for a minute and it's no burden on either one of us. It's just a nice thing to do and it just becomes routine and a non-issue."

Lausannea,2022-05-25,-1,"There's a HUGE HUGE difference between someone being squeamish and having a phobia of needles. The latter can be considered a disability in and of itself. I have a friend who practically faints at the sight of a needle, and she has to plan an entire day to recover from getting a flu shot (which she gets dutifully every single year to help protect more vulnerable friends, aka her disabled diabetic friends and others) because she requires heavy anxiety meds to get through it all. It royally fucks her up.

You don't get to decide for someone whether they're just being squeamish or they have a genuine disabling phobia anymore than nondiabetics get to decide where and how we inject in public.

Here's the thing: it costs nothing to ask people you hang out with often if anyone struggles with needles, and to give them a quick, 1 second heads up to look away. You don't need to relocate yourself, you don't need to do anything different, you just need to tell someone ""Look away for a minute, injection"". That's it.

If that's too much to ask for... you're kind of being a dick, because you don't care about others. And if giving that heads up is too much and will lead to burnout, you can open a dialogue with your friends and ask what a good way is to manage both aspects of it.

GlitchyProxy,2022-05-25,2,"Ive had friends who are squeamish as well, but theyve gotten used to me pricking my fingers and taking shots. Since Ive had diabetes pretty much my entire life, Ive also gotten quick and discrete enough to the point where they may not even notice Ive done it. Literally, in public I'll just through the motions under the table and continue the convo like nothings happening. When it comes to being at home or work with people who aren't used to it, without saying anything I'll go to a nearby table and let them have a choice of seeing from a distance or looking away. That sorta helps desensitize them. If it's a small space I might just turn away a little bit, but typically after the first time, people should know what's happening if they see the diabetes kit coming out and they have the choice of looking away or not.

I do a lot of these things out of courtesy for people who aren't used to it, and as a way to continue conversations without interrupting and distracting everyone. It's a happy median, and ultimately my choice whether or not I feel like doing it, as it is for you. As for the bathroom/another room thing - You should not have to interrupt yourself and what you're doing 10 times a day everyday for the rest of your life for something that should take a few seconds. That's exhausting mentally and physically."
Girlygabenpepe,2022-05-25,2,"No, we just live our lives. I don't go anywhere to inject myself, I just yolo and do it wherever. I even stopped going through the fabric of thin dresses and stuff because I always bolus into my belly. If you do not feel comfortable doing it out in public you can always go to a more private place. I think this should be more a question of personal preference rather than etiquette. You do not have to cater anyone's needs with your diabetes but your own. That is really important. If somebody says, ""I get squeamish when you do it"" I just tell them to look away and then also tell them when I am done and if they ask rudely, I just disregard that comment completely. You do not have to consider people who get squeamish like that too much when injecting yourself around others, because ultimately, they also have to learn to deal with that. Injections are fairly normal nowadays and you might be doing them a favor by introducing them to the reality that a lot of people need injections daily. My brother is squeamish around needles but I think it is important to also never hide your disease because it is less comfortable for others. I like saying stuff like: ""Then it's good that it's me and not you who has this disease"" or something like that. I think it is an unnecessary complaint. People can see for themselves when you take your syringe out or your pen. It's not your job to please them. It is definitely their problem and not yours. And I also like considering other people's feelings but with diabetes, I think different rules apply than for regular stuff."
SplitAffectionate844,2022-05-25,2,"Reminds me of the first time I had to do my needle in front of my uni friends, one of them I had just met that day. They went surfing and I went to take photos. We went to McDonalds after it and sat in the car. I was in the back with the person I had just met that day and being a diabetic for close to 20 years at this point, I knew to ask if anyone had an issue with needles. He noped right out of the car and waited till I was done before he got back in to eat and ask lots of questions. Almost 7 years on and hes a lot better, sometimes he will look closely as I do it and then nope out. Hes also the one that asks the most random questions. Hes fine now as long as I dont put the pen anywhere near him. Freaks out even when theres no needle attached, freaks out harder when there is a needle attached with the cap on. I would never joke with it when the cap isnt on. 

As for other people, Ive had lots of dirty looks, some ask questions and tell me about someone they know with diabetes, had someone almost bump into me with her kids as she walked past me just as I put the needle in my stomach. You get different reactions, but Ive never had anyone say anything overly rude about it. My response would just be sorry if me trying to stay alive is offensive to you, but my life saving medication is more important to me than a strangers feelings. Never had to use it in the 23 years of being a diabetic tho."

RogueGirl11,2022-05-25,2,"I'm not on insulin, but was in a study where I was. 

I just bolused wherever. But having said that, it's not like I stood up on a table and shouted, ""Hey! Look at me!"" I did it discreetly, but in public. 

This, in my opinion is similar to breastfeeding in public. I would never dream of saying to someone, ""That's gross/obscene etc. Go to the bathroom to do that!""  I feel life saving medication is in the same category."
Lausannea,2022-05-25,1,"So I replied this to a few comments, but...

It's free to give a quick heads up to a friend. ""Taking insulin, look away for a minute."" If it's embarrassing to give your insulin and have the focus on it, talk to your friend about a non-verbal way to communicate that it's happening.

Here's the thing: needle phobias are real, and they're awful. Many people pale and faint at just seeing a needle. It's not a choice, their brains just short circuit and they pass out or have panic attacks. It sucks super fucking hard for them because a) they can faint, which is awful, especially in public, and it can lead to injuries, and b) it can make access to healthcare more difficult. Things like vaccinations and medication shots that they need for non-diabetic reasons become nightmares to deal with. There are diabetics who constantly go into DKA because they can't take their own injections and put them off over this kind of phobia.

I have a friend with a severe needle phobia who needs to take *the whole day off* to deal with getting a flu shot. She's a health conscious person who wants to get the shot to help protect her vulnerable loved ones, including several diabetic friends, so she gets all her vaccinations every year and for COVID. It's a nightmare for her that is not helped by exposure therapy. She faints during shots, she takes anxiety meds to help cope, and... her only request to her injecting diabetic friends is a heads up.

Now, I'm of the opinion we shouldn't have to bend over backwards to do what we need to do to stay alive. Insulin comes first, always. But I'm not sure that giving someone a quick nudge and saying ""Taking insulin"", or discussing a non-verbal alternative, counts as being a burden that inhibits us from taking our insulin. If it is, then the burnout is deep seated and professional help to find healthier coping skills is likely needed. 

The bottom line is this: when someone you care about asks you nicely to give them a heads up so they don't have to deal with the anxiety and panic of seeing a needle, do you really think it's a kind thing to ignore this and keep on doing what you're doing, with no regard for their comfort? They're not asking anything big from you. They're not telling you to not inject in front of them, to go to the bathroom, or other shitty comments. They're likely hugely in favor of you taking the medication you need, and they are also aware that their phobia is not logical, but that's how phobias are. They're just asking to have their anxiety considered in a non-intrusive way.

People who are not at your table need to mind their own fucking business, and you can inject as needed. But they're likely people you're only around once, and your friends are people you're likely around often, and that difference matters. 

Be kind to your friends. They're the ones that have your back when shit goes wrong and you're in a medical emergency where you need help. Why is being nice to them and nudging their knee or saying a few words such a hardship that it outweighs your desire for them to be comfortable?"

There are some people who are squamish, or down right have phobias, about blood and needles so we should take precautions just like we would like people to do it for us.
Ofc, hygiene is quite important as well, wouldn't wanna inject myself in a bathroom that reals of shit even outside the door. We also need to avoid accident prone environment, wouldn't want someone  bumping my elbow and breaking of a needle inside my body."
BeatPeet,2022-05-24,-3,"Am I the only one here who tries to be discreet and/or go somewhere private to jab themselves?

I think you were being a d*ck OP. Your (supposed) friend is squeamish around needles and simply asks you to give her a heads-up before you bolus. And you couldn't even be arsed to do that.

My boss can't see blood so I try to prick my finger when he's not present. ""I wasn't asked to be diabetic"" is not an argument; I wasn't asked whether I want to have to shit every day and still I don't do that in front of others."
Wrong_Owl,2022-05-24,6,"I was very squeamish around needles before my diagnosis, so I empathize with people who are as well.

I don't think we need to go somewhere private for a jab, since as others have mentioned, bathrooms are a bit unsanitary to use equipment that touches or goes into your body.

My go-to has been to give myself blood glucose checks and insulin injections wherever I'm at, but you can do that without making it obvious or flashing needles in front of everybody. I'm usually at a table or seated somewhere when I'm out in public or have company over.

It's pretty discreet to give myself a finger-stick or a shot on my abdomen while sitting down. For the rest of it (drawing insulin or checking the meter), I haven't had any problems with having my equipment on the table and keeping everything close to me.

&amp;#x200B;

If a friend went out of their way to tell me they were squirmish about my stuff, I would be willing to be even more discreet about it around them, but in general, using your equipment is something you have to do, and I don't want to add to the stigma against taking medicine/shots/other things that are necessary but uncomfortable by hiding away each time.

We should be able to use our equipment in public, and if someone isn't used to seeing it, maybe it can lead to a good conversation."

dashiellsayshi,2022-04-30,21,"You can definitely eat sushi more than four times a year! Here are a few things that can help keep you from spiking so hard, beyond trying to give yourself a shot before/during/after.

\- Ask for half rice on everything. You really won't notice a profound difference in any rolls/cut sushi, but your blood sugar definitely will

\- Sauce on the side. Anything like a sweet eel sauce will be a huge spike. Just drizzle a little on yourself.

\- Learn to love sashimi. It's the best! And zero carbs, plus you can get some really tasty versions like the popular albacore with crispy onions or yellowtail with jalapeno! Also depending on the sushi place, ask if they have any rolls without rice. A lot of them will do rolls that are just 100% fish/veggies wrapped up.

\- Go for a walk before or after. Just walking for 15 minutes can really help the insulin do its thing. Or try to have sushi on a day when you've already worked out, insulin always works a lot faster for me after a lot of activity.

forthelulzac,2022-05-01,2,"I have a question - when places have a combo of sushi and sashimi with a California roll, what is the sushi? Is it nigiri? Is it another roll? Is it just a piece of fish?"
SeabgfKirby,2022-05-01,2,"Sushi just refers to the rice. Sashimi is a piece of fish. Nigiri is ""two fingers"" of rice with a topping."
gomezthekiller,2022-04-30,18,My dietician warned me about white rice. Im pretty sure thats what youre seeing. Apparently its the worst carb for diabetics (and it kills me because I love sushi too!). Gotta switch to sashimi!
beowhulf,2022-04-30,7,"i can only speak from experience and not as a dietician but for me its not the rice itself its the combination of rice with raw meat, in this case fish, but same happens with medium rare steak. If i eat rice with chicken i dont spike up, i can balance with insulin, same with other meals, but once i combine it with raw meat, so sushi or steak, i spike up 3 hours later, its like the raw meat slows down the digestion rapidly and then i start to metabolize much later"
tomytronics,2022-04-30,4,Explains why sushi with eel doesn't cause issue while raw tuna does.
GrandOpening,2022-05-01,5,"A little bit of insight from a culinary arts Instructor who has sushi week in one of her classes:  Its not the rice/raw protein combo. Its the sushi zu. Sushi zu is a combination of vinegar, sugar, and seasonings used to season the sushi rice as it cools   
In prepared sushi, the flavor isnt noticeable. Its meant to be a subtle enhancer and aid in the stickiness of the rice. If you ate the rice alone, you would likely notice that it tastes a touch weird.  
So, if you are calculating for regular white rice, you are missing the carbs from the zu. . 
The protein does slow the absorption of the carbs. Maybe more than cooked protein (unknown as far as Im aware)."
ToffeeCoffee,2022-04-30,4,"Also just to add chicken with rice and sushi is different as well. Sushi rice usually has a lot of added sugar, can be several teaspoons per serving/dish. So if you're eating a lot of sushi, that sugar really adds up. It's like drinking a cup of coffee with 10 teaspoons of sugar!"
matchurin,2022-05-01,1,Interesting observation.  I was wondering if u have a sensitivity to seaweed or something added to the seaweed when it is prepared.  What happens when u eat just seaweed snacks?  My body has a similar response to seaweed &amp; sushi rolls.
thechrizzo,2022-04-30,7,what? Strange comment. Mine told me rice is totally fine but high/fast carbs. What I would suggest here is that the protein of the fish is kicking in (3-4 hours makes sense) and I have to inject 1dose correction per 100g of fish/meat I eat after \~3-4 hours
zmmm268,2022-04-30,4,I am pretty sure they add sugar to sushi rice. That may be the difference.
Gorkymalorki,2022-04-30,4,They do add sugar to sushi rice.

celestia1s,2022-04-30,3,it depends on how the sushi rice is prepared some restaurants throw in sugar too. so u gotta add like an extra 10-20g of carbs per 6 rolls
NurseSkaren,2022-04-30,2,I used to have that same problem but have learned that increasing my basal by 50% for 8 hours (from the time my sushi meal ends) usually works quite well to combat this.

Greymalkinizer,2022-04-30,2,"There are a few foods that we have developed a double-schedule for.  With things like pizza, we do a 3/4 carb dose before eating and then the remainder dosed 1-2 hours later.  It's the only way to keep BG under control overnight even though the second dose always feels like tempting fate since BG looks under control when it triggers."
itreallyhappened8899,2022-04-30,5,I think the answer is to eat more sushi as at some point it just kills you and your BG level does not matter anymore. That is the approach I am taking but I am not a doctor so do so at your own risk.

I even increased my basal because I knew more was coming. Still shot up to almost 400 because the dexcom alarm didn't wake me up. But the thirst and having to pee woke me up and I knew before I even checked I was in bad territory. I bolused and increased my basal more and balanced out within a few hours.

GrumpyKitten1,2022-05-01,1,"If it helps I've had really good success making my own sushi rolls. The rice is replaced with cream cheese, cauliflower rice and sushi vinegar. The cauliflower gives the right texture, the cream cheese gives it the sticky and what you taste is the vinegar. (I admit that they were not as pretty as professionally made but my family couldn't tell the difference in the taste).


The nori was hard to find and I had limited options for the vinegar but the ingredients go a long way if you can find them."

mahuska,2022-05-01,1,Find a sushi shop that makes sushi in a style that uses thinly sliced cucumber that's marinated in a certain kind of creamy sauce as a substitute for rice it's absolutely wonderful I'd bet I'd probably prefer it but not very many know how to do it. I think it's a bit more high end than standard sushi. I just came across it by accident I'm going to be Dallas.
ScottRoberts79,2022-05-01,1,"Don't forget - your body processes somewhere around 35-60g of carbs an hour. So on a high carb meal, you're still absorbing carbs when the insulin runs out. Multiple shots or extended bolus are necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

And don't forget about all the protein you're eating. That protein ends up as sugar...... I have to bolus half as much for protein as for carbs, but I can't ignore it or I get those 3-4hr later spikes."

NextEstablishment815,2022-05-03,1,It's actually the fat content.  Definitely lots of carbs in the rice and some protein in the fish but the amount of fat is much higher than people realize.  I've had Japanese acquaintances tell me they won't eat sushi because it's too fatty.  Fat metabolizes last and does convert to carbs eventually.  You could consider an additional bolus timed to peak at 2 1/2 - 3 hours.

( I think I eat around 100-150 carbs a day and my bolus is 1 unit per 8 carbs) what is yours ?"
WCPass,2022-05-18,3,Probably 17-20? Basal is 7 a night and then Bolus varies a bit. I just don't eat a ton in general though
DiabeticCumshot,2022-05-18,1,Wow good for you thats a true sign of a great diet to have such a small number! I wish I could be that low to save money on Insulin because its so expensive in my country. Unfortunately i actually had a slight DKA episode when I tried doing an extremely low carb diet so I had to more than double my carb intake from when I went on that diet and I told myself Ill never go on a diet again lol
WCPass,2022-05-18,2,"I'm very much a meat and potatoes type guy, so all I really did when I was diagnosed was cut down on potatoes.  I'll have eggs and bacon or something for breakfast then meat and potatoes for dinner. Drink lots of water during the day to keep the snacking down"
DiabeticCumshot,2022-05-18,1,"Same here I love chicken, eggs, Bacon, beef, and drink tons of water but I still force myself to get in carbs daily so I dont go into a DKA episode again. I used to be closer towards your daily insulin amount when I was dieting (around 25 units a day) but it wasnt enough for my body. Youre lucky you can get away with only 17-20 a day, as someone who loves to diet Im jealous  :) Just goes to show how different we all are !"
WCPass,2022-05-18,1,"It is interesting to see how the same things effect us differently. I wasn't trying to flex or anything, it just wasn't a huge change from my pre diagnosis diet, just had to cut down in the snacking. I also try to run pretty low, so if I do I want a snack I can have like a 7g of carb keto bar and still be in range without bolus. Hope your numbers and health are doing well!"
DiabeticCumshot,2022-05-18,1,"Sounds like you were diagnosed a lot later in life than I was because when I first got my diabetes I couldnt tell you what I was eating beforehand lol but Thank you and same to you, best of luck with these wonderful disease we have !!"
East-Tumbleweed,2022-05-18,1,"I'm interested, how did you go into DKA? Was it Euglycemic DKA?"
DiabeticCumshot,2022-05-18,1,"Not it was a regular DKA because my blood glucose levels were slightly high as well. The few days before I started experiencing the highs that caused the DKA I was dropping low from my basal rate being too high (the rate I had when I wasnt on a diet was fine but than once I went on the no carb diet my basal was far too high) so I had to make adjustments and those didnt go so well as I was too high for 2-3 days straight which caused my slight DKA experience


It was a mix of not eating enough carbs therefor not getting enough Insulin and my blood glucose levels being elevated

The reason I blame it more on the diet is because my blood glucose levels werent crazy high they were what I experience in a normal month for myself its just the fact that I was dieting on top of those normal high numbers meant the insulin deficiency was the main difference in what caused the DKA compared to when Im normally seeing those high numbers from eating a lot of carbs"
East-Tumbleweed,2022-05-18,1,"So was the insulin deficiency from lowering your basal or from not having as high a bolus?

My thought is - as long as you are getting enough insulin to cover the carbs you do eat, as well as the protein you've subbed it for (and basal for the glucose your body generates on its own), you should be fine. Does that sound wrong from your experience?

Also, did you bolus for protein, and did you change your ratio at all?"
DiabeticCumshot,2022-05-18,1,"It was a combination of my basal not being high enough from my own stupidity trying to adjust it, + eating no carbs which made me basically have little to no bolus on top of the bad blood sugar. And no I never knew about bolusing for protein until recently so that also didnt help as most of my zero carb meals were semi high in protein

Your thought about DKA seems correct though"
East-Tumbleweed,2022-05-18,1,"Oh, that's super interesting! Maybe I will stop adjusting my basal LOL. Did you have a correction scale for highs given by your doctor?   


Thanks for sharing your experiences by the way! I am trying to do this responsibly and so far I've seen fantastic results. I just don't have the patience to wait for my doctors to condone it as I feel crappy with high carbs and high blood sugar that goes with it. I can imagine you had the same thoughts in the beginning?   


I'll make sure to be super careful with this."

Phototoxin,2022-05-18,2,"I take different amounts for different meals since they will be different amounts of carbs.
The L is for lantus."
DiabeticCumshot,2022-05-18,1,So those 4 numbers are your doses of Lantus per meal or per day ?
Rockitnonstop,2022-05-18,5,I would read it as the first three are short acting and the last one is Lantus.

LonelyLifepartner85,2022-05-18,1,Basal and bolus. I'm around 60% basal and 40% bolus. My carb estimates are probably off by 5 to 10 units of insulin. Carb ratio is 1 to 4.

pancreaticallybroke,2022-05-18,1,No. I had to come off my pump for a few months last year and had to go back onto injections. Those figures are what I was using on injections compared to what I use when I'm on my pump. Now back on my pump thankfully. The only time I inject now is if I think my pump might have malfunctioned.
DiabeticCumshot,2022-05-18,1,Wait so why is there such a massive change from your daily insulin intake when youre on your pump compared to just needles ? Also glad to hear youre back on the pump and happy with it :)
pancreaticallybroke,2022-05-18,2,"People do usually use less insulin on a pump than they do on injections. It's usually around 20% less I think. I have no idea why my body reacts this way to injections and neither does my Dr. I've always had issues with it and I'm brittle so that may have something to do with it. Unfortunately my diabetes just doesn't play nicely and injections just don't work like they should. I was put on a pump over a decade ago now and I think the lowest my A1c had been was about 135. It's still difficult but I have more tools to tackle it now I'm on a pump. Unfortunately, running that high for a long time has done it's damage though."

Been T1D for 30 years. A1C was 7.1 (best for me in a long time)"
Rockitnonstop,2022-05-18,1,"26-28ish depending on carbs. Usually on the lower side of that due to exercise. 22 Lantus and the rest Humalog. 

After I started weight lifting last year, I had to drop my Lantus from 25 to 22 because my insulin sensitivity went up so much, that dose hadnt changed in 15 years since I started despite being a very acting person (running and cycling). 

Similarly, I used to take about 68 units of insulin in my teenage years (56 NPH and 4R in the AM and 4NPH and 4R in the evening) due to hormones. So it really depends on a lot of factors. Been relatively the same weight the entire time (57 135-140lb F),"
KokoPuff12,2022-05-18,1,"My current average is 22.5 total. 11.6 bolus and 10.9 basal. 

It makes sense that basal ends up a little lower because I will often build basal into a correction dose to get back in range faster. Then, I turn the basal off to prevent a low an hour later."
Mickoz666,2022-05-18,1,I average 60 units per day of NovoRapid via pump. My basal rate varies from about 1u per hour up to 2.7iu per hour depending on my usual insulin sensitivity variation.
TheJesusSixSixSix,2022-05-18,1,I usually take 10-12 units of humalog and 12 of semglee at night.
NonSequitorSquirrel,2022-05-18,1,I'm between 25 and 35 tdd depending on what I eat.
niff20,2022-05-18,1,On a pump and usually I take 70-90 units of U200 insulin a day. 100 units on really stubborn bg days or days where I eat more.
Frequentlyaskedquest,2022-05-18,1,"I take 15 iu of my slow acting one and 3+4+6 of novorapid, so around 28 a day

This said, Ive had to correct in between for about a month now, I correct about 2 or 3 times a day with about 2 or 3 extra units.

Id say my real average is around 35 ui a day total"
JanovPelorat,2022-05-18,1,"Basal I take 26 total split 12 in the morning and 14 at night.  I average about 6 to 8 of humalog per day depending on what I eat, but I try and keep my daily carbs below 50g.  Usually take one, sometimes 2 units of hum to deal with dawn phenomenon, though that hasn't been necessary this past week or so for some reason."
AeroNoob333,2022-05-18,1,"18-22U. About 8-12U on long acting depending on where Im at on my cycle, if Ive been eating too much fat or drinking too much alcohol. Then, my short acting is usually 3-4U per meal about 3-4x a day."
DLeader91,2022-05-18,1,I work a swing shift so I have 8 different basal setting then different profiles for working at night and working days. (12 hour shifts) 25-28 basal total for 24 hours and 20-30 bolus total. I also have different correction factors and sensitivities depending on which way my metabolism likes to swing. If I exercise or spend the day in the yard and don't eat like a pig that day I MIGHT take 10 units bolus and turn on the exercise setting. Does that only make my bolus less or does it take my basal settings down as well?
PastelPainter829,2022-05-18,1,20 basal and about 18 bolus
Guywith2dogs,2022-05-18,1,"My basal changes up a little during the day depending on how active I am, but its always between 1u per hour and 1.2u per hour. If I'm really really active I'll drop it quite a bit though, sometimes by half or more. Exercise absolutely drains the glucose from my body, so if I were to do something strenuous at my normal 1u per hour I'd plummet super fast and even drinking juice only stops it for a short period. Bolus obviously depends on my meal, but I rarely have to bolus more than 2u. Most of the time it's between 1u and 1.5u. I always thought it was weird because I've been T1 for 28 years and I expected to have really bad insulin resistance after so long. I'm not complaining though."
East-Tumbleweed,2022-05-18,1,"20-25 basal, plus 3-6 for bolus and corrections"
CosmicSmackdown,2022-05-18,1,"I have high IR and use a lot of insulin, even with lower carb. An average for the last three days for me is 214 units a day. There are days when I use 300 units or so."
DiabeticCumshot,2022-05-18,2,Very impressive that youre giving yourself so much insulin on a daily basis (assuming you eat a bit of carbs daily) yet your a1-c is so low. You are goals my friend
CosmicSmackdown,2022-05-18,1,"The power of an insulin pump and CGM! Those two, combined, make life much easier for me.  Im in range probably 80 to 90% of the time. Sometimes Ill have a week or two or more when Im in range 98 or 99% of the time.

I actually need less insulin when I eat a moderate carb plant based diet than when I eat very low carb. For me, the insulin resistance is a real bitch and lower fat and plant-based help that. Its kind of crazy that a grilled steak or chicken breast requires more insulin for me than a small bowl of brown rice. Im not happy with a super low carb diet and Im not happy with a super low fat diet so I utilize an adapted Mediterranean way of eating while avoiding gluten (celiac) and keeping carbohydrates under 80 grams most days."
DiabeticCumshot,2022-05-18,2,"Wow chicken breast and steak have zero carbs at least the ones that I make so that blows my mind that you bolus for those. Also very interesting youre only eating 80 or less carbs a day yet youre getting over 200 units per day& my average carb intake is almost double of yours yet I only get 18-19 units to cover that lol such a drastic difference between us

I truly dont understand how you cover less for rice than steak and chicken lol Im still mind blown at that"
CosmicSmackdown,2022-05-18,1,"My I:C is 1:1 for most, but not all, foods. I also bolus for about 80% of protein &amp; 35% of fat but again, that seems to depend on the food. Its a very fine balancing act and some days I get frustrated and want to throw my hands in the air and walk away but of course I cant so I just deal with it."
DiabeticCumshot,2022-05-18,1,"Wow truly amazing how different each of us are. The difference between your 1:1 and my 1:8 is night and day ! 

As someone with a 7.2 A1C Id love to have my a1c as low as yours and have your struggles ! I tend to panic when I trend low which causes most of my struggles with maintaining a better a1c"
Boc5726,2022-05-18,1,"My 7 and 14 day averages are about 47 units/day of humalog.  It breaks down to about 50% basal, 44% food bolus and 6% correction boluses over those stretches."
DiabeticCumshot,2022-05-18,1,"Nice!! Very similar to my own numbers, youre probably the closest out of everyone to comment so far :)"
Boc5726,2022-05-18,1,"This got me to look at my Dexcom Clarity charts for the first time in a few weeks.  Might make a few minor basal adjustments based on the trend data I'm seeing, so thanks for spurring me to do that."
traphouseboba,2022-05-18,1,fast acting units probably end up around 12 or 13 honestly
Toxikfoxx,2022-05-18,1,46 basal and 29 bolus as of yesterday. I average 75 usually.
RachelWolf7,2022-05-19,1,80 units for basal and usually 150 units for carbs but I havent been eating that much lately so maybe 50 units for carbs right now.

StrangerGlue,2022-05-04,17,"I know masks are uncomfortable but they're really important. My mom's blood sugars were totally out of control when she had covid  and she had no other symptoms except an aching back. 20mL of orange juice took her from 3.4 to 12.7  that's like a single sip. The same day she ate a meal with 30g of carbs without insulin and her sugars went from 10.0 to 7.5 (while bedbound!)

Wear a respirator whenever you can. Lots of people find the fold-flats ""fish"" or origami style more comfortable; but I like the ones with vertical seams down the centre because they give me the most 'breathing room' of any mask.

Make sure it fits tight (if you suck in your breath hard and fast, it should collapse some). I have best comfort and fit with behind-the-head straps.

If you can't get a respirator, use the CDC's ""knot and tuck"" trick with a surgical/procedure mask, and consider another mask on top as well."
suchahotmess,2022-05-04,4,"Masks that are structured and a little bit stiff are great for comfortable breathing! I still wear a cloth mask whenever Im in indoors public because Im not risking it, and Ive actually been thinking I need to start starching them."

Assuming 4l of blood then that's 37.2 mmols = 6.7g.  But 20ml of OJ only contains 2g of sugars, meaning that for even just for the blood glucose increase a lot is coming from somewhere else.  That's scary if a bit of OJ is precipitating a glucose dump from elsewhere."

#**PROTEST SAFELY WITH DIABETES**

**MAKE SURE YOU:**

* Go with friends
* Keep these items **ON YOUR BODY**, not in a backpack:
 * Insulin (few days worth)
 * Medical ID (bracelet)
 * Low supplies - gel, tabs, and glucagon
 * Blood glucose meter and strips (even if on CGM) 
 * Personal identification card, phone number of emergency contact who is not at protest

**GOOD TO HAVE:**

* CGM Receiver in case your phone is taken
* Water to stay hydrated

**GOOD TO DO:**

* Tell someone when you are expected back
* Tell your friends what to say to police about your diabetes

**IF ON A PUMP:**

* Make sure the reservoir is full
* Take a photo/write down your settings
* Know how much long-acting insulin you need if you lose access to your pump

**If arrested, know your rights!**

**Read ACLU Protest Guide**

friendless2,2022-05-04,-19,"Actually it is safer to NOT protest with diabetes.

No risk of being arrested, separated from your medication and death from lack of access to insulin.

The authorities are not there to manage diabetes.  You will get limited shots if any at all.  You will be running high glucose the entire time you are detained.  All supplies on you or in your backpack will be confiscated.  You will not have access to anything you need to manage diabetes.

No protest is worth your life."

in_the_sheyd,2022-05-04,6,"Quite the opposite, actually.

You need to be loudly and clearly communicating this information such that legal observers and other activists know who you and know that you need medical attention. Unless you communicate this information to your arresting officer in a way that is observed by friendly third parties the chance that you will not actually receive the medical care you need to live will be much reduced or will be delayed such that you could suffer medical consequences.

Also refusing to say anything whatsoever to your arresting officer is just going to antagonize them and they'll likely take it out on you while you're under their custody. That just sucks. Don't do that.

Especially don't refuse to answer questions like what your legal name is, your address, gender, and the like. It's pointless and it just makes your officer's life difficult and it'll piss them off and that'll make your night suck even more. Also your officer is going to search you and they will ask if you are carrying anything sharp or dangerous that they might come into contact with and for all that is good and holy in this world answer that question honestly and disclose your medical supplies.

Try to be civil with your arresting officer even if they are a fascist pig and have succinct, to the point conversations about the things you need to communicate. Just don't get chatty."

I just keep sugar packs and take them with water. I try to avoid chewing on the sugar so that it doesn't stick in the fissures, so I just pour the sugar towards the back of my throat and wash it down with water.

Another thing you can do is mix a glass of water with sugar before you go to sleep and drink it with a straw when needed. It lessens the direct contact of the sugar on your teeth and also shortens the time of contact with your teeth.

As for your dentist - fuck you, bitch. Yeah, my teeth are important and I care for them, but I think my neurons are more important and I'd rather not be brain dead because of a hypo. What do you want me to do? Stick an intravenous glucose so I can bypass my teeth? Unless you have a better idea or if there is a better solution for at hand immediate hypos, keep your condescending laugh to yourself.

nrgins,2022-05-25,2,"Well, I guess you're lucky. But I do end up needing sugar during the night sometimes. If you ever do need sugar, do you get up and brush afterwards?"
KokoPuff12,2022-05-25,2,"I do. I can usually avoid a low by reducing my basal if I drop below 75. If I get below 65, I treat the low. When my sugar is back in range, I rinse with water. Then, I wait fifteen minutes and brush. Normally, I can go to bed around 90 and stay within about 10 points. My basal used to be way too high and I would aim to go to bed at 180 to wake up under 130."

ImpossibleHandle4,2022-05-03,10,"This is my 32nd year of diabetes. Back in 1990 when I was diagnosed, they were telling us that a cure is 10 years away, and we will have a closed loop system in 5. The closed loop was approved in 2017&& 

With the doom and gloom out of the way, there have been and are some great strides being made. 

1) the closed loop system is real. It mostly works. (I had the 670 and the 770g and my A1c has gone up& :( 

2) insulin is now working a lot more like it works in the body, ie: super fast acting insulin without having to inject it into a vein. 

3) beta cell transplants are a thing and have been gaining steam. (The biggest problem is the immunosuppressants)

4) cellular de-differentiation is a thing. This allows scientists to take your cells and turn them into pluripotent cells (basically into whatever kind of cell they want to grow) while maintaining your genetic markers (lower rejection risk) 

5) we have learned a lot about T-cells and how they work, and how they communicate. (We also learned that some older diseases were able to wipe genetic memory which in the case of diabetes would mean all new vaccinations, but with pluripotent stem cells and the body not attacking them, it might be possible, (the research is not to this level yet. This is all theoretical studies at this point)

So is a cure 5 years out? I hope so, but I wont believe it until it is all over the news and no one has died from it for a few years. (Look up inhalable insulin and smokers)"
sinanonur,2022-05-03,2,"Thanks. This is the kind of discuaaion that is really informative and helpful. i would also add to the list potential capsules that protect the cells from the immune system. They seem to be a good step until they find a way to reverse the immune response.

MuttonDelmonico,2022-05-03,3,"As you see, they've been saying it forever.

This time I think it's possible. The stuff they're doing with islet cell transplants is completely amazing - we know that they work. Some people with islet cell transplants (cells harvested from dead organ donors) have been off insulin for 10+ years. But those surgeries are rare. Now they're using stem cells to grow new healthy islet cells, and the next challenge is hiding the cells from the immune system so we don't have to take immunosuppressive drugs. They're working on it hard in multiple ways, but who knows if they get it right.

However, even if everything goes perfectly, YOU are not going to get the cure in 5 years. 5 years is when a few people in a laboratory might be cured (and we won't even know they're cured for another few years anyway). 10 years is when a limited number of people with extreme need (or wealth) might get it - like people that have had many bouts of DKA and extreme hypo unawareness.  15 years is my *very* *optimistic* and completely amateur prediction.

I've had type 1 for over 20 years and while I most definitely want a cure, I feel like I'd also be in a sort of panic to undergo such a dramatic, life-changing overnight. I think I'd have a hard time trusting that my blood sugar can be regulated without any intervention on my part. I would assume the recommendation from medical professionals would be to continue monitoring your blood sugar in the short term, but for how long? I think I'd probably continue wearing a CGM for at least a year.

I've also worn a pump nearly every day for the last 20 years, and even though I would welcome the day to no longer carry this pager around, I'd somehow feel unsafe without it."

* We allocate some of our attention and brain power for just surviving. Since this will be released i expect to be more attentive of other things
* Above awerage willpower to resist ordinary temptations :D

'the cure is 5 years away' is literally the phrasing we use to joke about how we're always told a cure is around the corner. 'just gotta wait another 5 years.'

the news phrase these things the same way every time 'cure just around the corner' and then we have to explain to all the people misinformed by this news about what the studies referenced actually mean.

no op, until you see case studies, dont assume there's a cure. the things with the stem cell implants have been there the last ten years, and more. not particularly exciting yet. cant believe theyre accepting the marketing pitch of the company representing themselves as close as news. some of the cases, ie there was one guy marketed as having been cured of type 1 on one of these therapies. when you look at his numbers they were nowhere near normal at all. 

when you hear someone on the sub sharing their experience being cured, ie from an early trial, thats when you should believe it. this stuff is marketing dicking around, theyre trying to get funding for their rich asses to profit off our illnesses."

WoefulHC,2022-05-03,1,"I was diagnosed in 1976. ""The cure is only 5 years away"" is something I heard at diagnosis. It has apparently been said repeatedly and consistently since at least the 1950s. While I sometimes hear about new treatments or tools that sound promising, the vast majority of those over the last 46 years were never brought to market. Or they were brought to market but then failed or were recalled. In many cases when you read the article it is clearly a press release made to drum up support or investment rather than something that appropriately talks about all the hurdles and risks that could prevent something from being released. 

TLDR: I'll believe in a cure when it is widely available at an affordable price. Most announcements like this are designed to raise funds for or awareness of the entities involved in the research."

I am 33 years old and have been hearing the same old story since I was a kid. 

My moms friend has a very aggressive form of cancer that spread throughout his body. His wife does not really believe in modern medicine and doctors. She takes a more holistic approach to healing. So anyhow her husband was in such bad shape that doctors only gave him five months to live. They told him to go home and spend as much time with his wife and kids as he could. His wife refusing to accept that as an answer went back to her hometown in Mexico and got an all natural plant based supplement that is supposed to help with cancer. 

She brought it back to the US and her husband started to take it. Within a months time a large chunk of her husbands cancer was gone. By month 2 it was almost as if the cancer was non existent. Yet the doctors ""cannot"" understand how a man went from 5 months to live to almost cancer free. Whatever he took she said is not approved by the FDA or US government. Yet despite this product eliminating cancer the doctors cannot call it a cure. I find it all fascinating how it all happens before our eyes and sometimes I feel like we are just guinea pigs for the medical industry."

JabberJaws222,2022-05-03,1,That's what they told my sister! 20 years ago...
vastmagick,2022-05-03,1,"&gt;I heard people saying 5 years is used as a joke.

It is more of a con when it comes to science.  5, 20, 50 years are great markers to throw out that makes it seem like something is coming but long enough that if nothing happens you aren't really held responsible for it.  In 5 years people can get another job.  In 20 budget cuts or loss of enough people could have impacted the work.  And in 50 a whole new paradigm could have come out to work on instead.

This isn't to say that science doesn't take 5, 20, or 50 years.  But people that know what they are doing don't say they have a cure being developed in 5, 20, or 50 years.  They say they are studying a potential cure that might be developed eventually, but that isn't a good news article."
sinanonur,2022-05-03,1,"i understand the frustration and disappointment caused by it. But I do think that progress is being made and that is good news. Regardless of howmany years it will take. 

About the expectations and mentioning exact deadlines. i didn't hear a serious scientist working on the subject giving a deadline these days. its not in the video either. They are carefull to give estimates specifically when asked and they are cautious about it and say no one can really know.

So i think a considerable part of the frustration is created internally also. 

Mosy people are unfortunetaly commenting about their memory of other news or their assumptions about what would be in the video. But to some degree that is how redddit works so that is to be expected i guess."
vastmagick,2022-05-03,1,"&gt;But I do think that progress is being made and that is good news. Regardless of howmany years it will take.

Please don't misunderstand what I wrote, progress is being made.  CGMs weren't a thing when I was diagnosed and they thought only carbs impacted blood sugar and if your numbers were wrong it was because you miscounted.

&gt;i didn't hear a serious scientist working on the subject giving a deadline these days

Yeah, that is generally my litmus test for if a scientist is serious or not.  Generally it is news articles that will give wild claim dates like diabetes will be cured in the next 5 years and their source will not say that at all.

&gt;Mosy people are unfortunetaly commenting about their memory of other news or their assumptions about what would be in the video.

Many of us have been there.  We read that headline that said we are the lucky ones that will only have to deal with this disease for a few years and then it will be cured and it is painful when you realize it isn't happening.  Now I am not saying it will never happen, but I do think it is harmful to believe a cure is just around the corner at any moment, for decades."
sinanonur,2022-05-03,1,"Yes i agree that skepticism is really healthy and more than that it is a must. 

No one should assume that it is just around the corner. 

But the thing is no one in the video is saying that but many people in the comments assume they do.

0 guess it is partly my fault for the title. I wanted to joke about the meme and explain in the text that i dont think it is the case and i am suspicious. But it is misunderstood as 5 years being the claim of the video."
vastmagick,2022-05-03,1,"&gt;But the thing is no one in the video is saying that but many people in the comments assume they do.

That is because you used the title:

&gt;So is the cure really 5 years away

And they imply it with:

&gt;How There Could Finally Be A Cure For Diabetes

and 

&gt;Over the past 20 years, significant advancements in stem cell research and therapies have been one of the most promising methods of creating new insulin making cells needed to cure type 1 diabetes. 

That doesn't include the ban on stem cell research that ended only 13 years ago, so 7 of those 20 years didn't actually see significant advancements in the US (and I have caught myself being US centric, so please anyone aware of stem cell research in those 7 years help educate this dumb American\[me\]).

And the big thing is that I feel the arm band that I have worn since I was diagnosed that says Insulin Is Not A Cure needs to be supplemented with Immunosuppressants Are Not A Cure."
sinanonur,2022-05-03,1,"&gt;That is because you used the title:  
&gt;  
&gt;So is the cure really 5 years away

Besides the fact that ""Cure is always 5 years away"" is a joke around the community and it was a reference to that, This is still a question for debate and have you seen what i actually wrote?

&gt;I am still skeptical of the cure happening soon.

I understand that this is really an emotional thing. But I really suspect many people evaluate the content without actually reading or watching it. Of course time might be valuable and you don't have to. But you don't have to comment in that case too.  


Video actually discusses the subject and says stem cells with immunosupressants are not actually a cure. And it is not considered as an option for most of the T1 diabetics unless you have very severe lows or You are already using immunosuppresants for other things like kidney implants etc.  


Here is also what the optimistic scientist (and T1D patient himself) says in the video:

&gt;  
11:22  
I would caution as a scientist that we need more data, we need more people in these trials.  
11:27  
We need competition, multiple companies working on this because there are still obstacles.  


So most of the response is I think understandably emotional but seems like pre-determined and independent of what the actual content is :)  


Anyway. Thank you for taking your time and discussing this."
vastmagick,2022-05-03,1,"&gt;This is still a question for debate and have you seen what i actually wrote?

I'm sorry, no I have not been tracking everything you are writing.  But you seem genuinely confused it evokes such a reaction while also aware it is a ""joke.""

&gt;Video actually discusses the subject and says stem cells with immunosupressants are not actually a cure.

I have watched the video multiple times now.  It says this, but why are you not questioning their title if they never talk about a cure?  The flip side of this coin of trying to inspire hope in diabetics is that we get flooded from people that don't know that say we will be cured soon so we don't need help.

&gt;11:22  
I would caution as a scientist that we need more data, we need more people in these trials.

I don't see that as optimistic.  This article misses, even while trying to address it, that diabetics need to be heard in this process.  A ""cure"" that none of us agree is a cure is wasted and I think a lot of us get frustrated with only being seen a points of data or potential trail subjects with only one opinion allowed on the subject.

&gt;11:27  
We need competition, multiple companies working on this because there are still obstacles.

We need caution.  G. W. Bush set us back by banning stem cell research and ignoring that potential to come back won't make it go away.

&gt;So most of the response is I think understandably emotional but seems like pre-determined and independent of what the actual content is :)

I think you are not listening completely.  The actual content is not new.  It has been said before and it ignores many concerns we have as a community.  And it is very dismissive to say that people are just being emotional and made determinations independent of what you shared.  The idea of transplant islet started in the 1893, we are now 129 years down the road and saying this idea is revolutionary."

Techfumaster,2022-05-12,31,"I get yearly scrips from my Endo.  He wants to see me every 3 months but I refuse.  I see him twice a year for blood tests, that's it. They want to see you every 3 mos because it satisfies the insurance company and they get an extra billing out of it.  But it's a waste of time and money (unless you are on meds that require more frequent testing of course).  And since I'm essentially cash pay with a HDHP, I make my own rules.  He can either see me twice a year and refill what I need, or I will find someone who will.  And we both know it.

You are the consumer.  Just because they want something doesn't mean you have to do it.  If you rephrase it in a different context ... Just because that's the product you want to sell me doesn't mean it's the product I have to buy.  Somewhere along the way in healthcare we've lost the consumer mindset and started to just agree to whatever the heck we are told to do.  That's asanine in my opinion.  

I respect my doctor's medical opinion or I would not go there, but I question everything.  Why should I do that therapy instead of this one, what makes xyz med better than what I'm taking now, is there something off label we should be looking at instead, could my test results indicate something else or is your conclusion the only one we can draw, etc.  My doc doesn't love me and my questions, but he respects the heck out of me because I make sure that I'm educated about my treatment plans and the meds I take.  He doesn't dictate to me, we collaborate on the decisions made about my care.  And I see him on the schedule that makes the most sense to me, not the one that makes the most dollars for him."

1) It's not a valid prescription if there's no Doctor-patient relationship. Federal law defines a doctor-patient relationship as having been seen in the last 12 months (6 for Medicare).

2) Your doctor only gets paid when they see you. Why should they take certain amounts of liability involving your care if they're not going to get compensated at all.

3) Insulin is inherently dangerous. You know this as T1. You've lived it since your diagnosis. Your doctor must keep up to date on what you're doing and what may need adjusted. Despite your dose not changing in 8 years, as we age our bodies don't always stay stable."

I think I only did this for a month and a half but my endo got so mad she told the nurses to not refill my prescription unless I showed up at my appointment. The situation was 50% how bad of an endo/person she was and 50% I couldn't afford these bills. But when I eventually went to see her because she was holding my insulin hostage she tried to introduce herself to me again, then when she saw my file she was like ""Oh, we've met before.

Anytime anything needs to be changed due to insurance the Endo never responds to the pharmacies questions so I end up having to go in person when that happens, too. Diabetes sucks enough without having to deal with more BS. End Rant. Lol!"

pmpork,2022-05-12,1,This. For some reason I thought they couldn't. But my gp is so much closer and deep down I think he likes playing endo a bit =
SaidToBe2Old4Reddit,2022-05-12,1,Over the years when I randomly need a scrip (rate since I buy outside the USA) I have asked a GP &amp; a random cardiologist friend. They know I've had it forever so they wrote it with no issue.
AeroNoob333,2022-05-12,2,"I agree. I used to see my doctor every quarter, but hes cut it down to twice a year. Ive never had issues so I he just trusts me lol.

ThisIsAbuse,2022-05-12,2,"It is this way for ANY medication. ""See us every 6-12 months for a check up or no refils"".

There is medical liability for needing to see you. Asking standard questions about health changes, illiness, check your weight, eyes, etc... ensures the medication is right for you. At times they have also offered suggestions for new meds or slight adjustments."
hardcoredragonhunter,2022-05-14,1,What is your opinion about these rules though
ThisIsAbuse,2022-05-14,2,"I think there were always be some folks who don't think to let their doctor know about health changes occurring in the last 6-12 months such has sudden noticeable weight loss/gain, pains, dizziness, etc and there will always be lawyers looking to sue doctors or drug companies when something happens. So the doctors have to do this. I dont like it but I agree they have to do this ""see me"" visits."
OneLostconfusedpuppy,2022-05-12,2,"My endo is pretty lax about it, mostly because my area has a lack of Endocrinologists, so as long as I see her nurse yearly, I can get a prescription for insulin.

That being said, a few years ago I visited Vancouver BC and picked up both Lantus and Humalog and now rotate them.  IE I use the first in first out, so I always have a box as a spare that is less than 6 months old, in case of a shortage."
MISTERDIEABETIC,2022-05-12,2,"I got my last Endo in South Carolina to over-write my insulin prescriptions. She was probably the best and most understanding doctor I've ever encountered (or at least tied with a pediatric doctor I had in my teens who was also a Type 1 Diabetic) 

But the endo would write my insulin prescriptions for double what I actually needed. Therefore, I stocked up on insulin since I'd met my deductible for the year thanks to going into DKA in February, so all my meds were free for the rest of the year and I made damn good use of that! Now I've got about 2 years' worth of insulin in my fridge and don't plan on getting any more filled anytime soon unless it's also free. If so, I'll donate some to a local free clinic as I've had to rely on one for insulin about 10 years ago and wouldn't have survived without them."

Obviously this is what I did when I was 22 = I did not see a doc for 3 years, I did not do any tests (apart of blood testing at home - twice per day maybe?). The result was that my control was shitty and I almost missed beginning of kidney's disease.

She asked me to change into a gown, which I thought was odd, but whatever. Then she took my cell phone, my watch, wallet, and my clothes a locked them in  locker. 
She says "" don't worry all your thing are safe and will be here when you get back"".
I said "" I'm going somewhere?""
 I'm beginning to get uncomfortable. Three hours later Three hours .....3!!!!! Hours!!!  I have been moved from room to room and I have not seen the doctor. I am boiling mad. I am pestering everyone trying find out what the hell is happening, Finally the nurse with the key comes.
 ""I'm out of here!!!! You people are crazy!!!!!!!!"" I yelled.
That nurse walked over to an emergency exit door , opened it up the alarm sounding, lights flashing, looked dead at me.

floyd2168,2022-05-12,1,I took care of my Dad at the end of his life.

He had been diabetic for 27 years and I had managed it for the last 7 years of his life and I agree about the appointments being a waste of time. I'm in the same boat now as an insulin dependent Type 2 just like my Dad. Go every 3 months to see a NP for 10 minutes just to get a script

People telling others to buy Walmart insulin without referring them to a doctor first makes it a dangerous recommendation BECAUSE it's not a 1:1 replacement.

Many people also can't make it work effectively. It's just inferior insulin to newer options."
SaidToBe2Old4Reddit,2022-05-24,1,"I used these two in combination before the others were invented. I did absolutely fine, and I was a teenager, and adjusted the dosage myself based on what my meter showed me in the immediate and as trends. It's not rocket science.

Honestly, people don't have to go to a DOCTOR to learn about the difference in how it runs. It's not rocket science. I could draw two simple diagrams that would have most people understanding it, and then at most 5 to 10 minutes of conversation to explain how to account for the graphs. Another 15 minutes for Q&amp;A ... With CGM or meter in hand, a sliding scale to cover highs, and some glucose around to fix the lows, it can be pretty easily worked out.

Definitely not ideal compared to the newer sexier insulins. But a truly reasonable, affordable alternative."
Lausannea,2022-05-25,1,"You used them before the others were invented, and you were likely told by someone what dosages to start with. If not, the healthcare system MASSIVELY failed you.

Somebody who is diagnosed today and only knows the newer insulins probably doesn't even understand the active times of their current insulin, how to stack properly, etc. They won't know shit about NPH/R.

Just because you did diacrobatics and lived to tell the tale doesn't mean you were being safe and smart. Luck played a part too. Dead in bed syndrome became a widely known term thanks to NPH/R. People who go back to NPH/R today, folks who were diagnosed in the 80's and before, and grew up with these very insulins, still experience massive hypos and bouts of DKA on a regular basis. There are many people on social media who talk about this, almost every day.

It's not a reasonable alternative. If it was, people wouldn't be literally dying over not having access to the 'sexier' insulins (can we please not call them that? Humalog is basically as old as R for crying out loud). This is a nonsense statement and awful comparison."
Run-And_Gun,2022-05-12,1,"Stop spreading disinformation.  Its no more dangerous than any other insulin.  Does it behave exactly the same(onset time, decay time, etc.) as modern insulins(like Novolog or Lantus)?  No, but it is no more dangerous, if not understood or used properly(i.e: talk to your endo/doctor first).  I used R &amp; N for over 22 years before moving to Novolog and a pump.  I know what Im talking about."
SaidToBe2Old4Reddit,2022-05-24,1,"Nope. I use that combo before Humalog &amp; Lantus were invented. It worked great, you just have to learn how to use it differently. It's not rocket science - the short acting R simply isn't as quick, and last longer than humalog. The long acting N isn't as long and has more of a slope up and down than the more flatlined Lantus. A little education with a little experimentation and you can manage just fine with them."

Mamamagpie,2022-05-07,16,"Organic only? More expensive. Canned or frozen food can be fine if you read the labels. 

What is wrong with seltzer?"
Pandora9802,2022-05-07,7,"I agree that most things labeled organic are marketing. I discovered the organic Horizon milk I always bought because the expiration date was further out than the regular containers isnt even remotely healthier and isnt exactly produced chemical free (implied with the word organic).

Rice in general is a bane to diabetics of all types - something about the way the grains digest gives you both a huge carb burst at the beginning of eating and then a second burst later. AND the carbs from rice dont last as long as carbs from bread or potatoes, meaning you often crash after the second spike.

Bread with fewer carbs per slice (usually lower calorie bread has fewer carbs) can work fine for diabetics. The potatoes rec surprises me, unless he meant sweet potatoes. Those have more nutrients and fewer carbs.

Canned foods tend to have more sodium. But theyre also easier to count calories and carbs - the nutrition info is easily available right on the label.

A lot of diabetics are also gluten intolerant or at least sensitive, so maybe his gluten free comments were around that? Just be careful because the way gluten free products replace the gluten is typically with rice flour, which has the same glucose effects as eating rice& But apparently coconut flour has way fewer carbs than wheat flour.

I havent hear anything negative around carbonation in general, so maybe he was assuming you are drinking sugared soda or thinks the chemicals in diet soda will kill you? They might, but something will eventually, so yolo. :)

Life is much more beautiful if you can work hard for a little while.

And honestly I really feel the doctor did a great job by not suggesting pills or insulin but rather try to work it on your own. My doctor suggested insulin the moment I was diagnosed with 13.9. I hated that doctor. He suggested I shouldnt say no to cake and can eat carbs as long as I am taking insulin.

You list you eat 40-60 carbs. I eat under thirty. For many years, including the years leading up to diagnosis. I have sooo many other problems and my blood sugar reflects daily pain and inflammation, not what Im eating. Saying its *just* about what youre eating and as you suggest eating junk and your body is a piece of chunk is a moral evaluation. There are other issues that can cause diabetes outside the realm of you ate your way to diabetes and all of your comments announce that as the only method of becoming diabetic. Its simply not true and diabetes is way more complicated than that. And type 1, which is included in this subreddit, is an autoimmune disease that has nothing to do with diet. 

Im not even saying food isnt important in controlling insulin resistance - Im saying insulin resistance is not the result of everyones moral failing with consuming too much high carb junk food. This is a support community, what do you think youre supporting by stigmatizing and making assumptions?"

abmunoz88,2022-05-07,5,"I think comments/recommendations about dieting is going to vary a lot depending on who you talk to. 

My primary is very much an ""everything in moderation"" type doctor. He doesn't believe in cutting out everything because he believes that just makes you crave it more, which leads to bingeing. His only exception to this rule is foods super high in salt and preservatives. He's especially passionate of me not going near packaged lunch meat/bacon.

jellyn7,2022-05-07,1,"I can come up with reasoning for most of these. The cans sounds odd at first, but BPAs (Bisphenol A) have been linked to diabetes. But you can find cans now that are advertised as BPA-free.

White potatoes are tricky. I'd say you'd have to test. And eating chips or french fries is going to be worse than cold potato salad. (Cooling it after cooking makes it into more of a resistant starch.)

Going Gluten Free would have the side effect of likely being lower carb. And if you WERE sensitive to gluten and didn't know it, then reducing inflammation is probably good.

The one I don't understand is carbonation. I know the seltzer water I drink isn't great for my teeth. But that's all I've got on that one!

If the doctor isn't a nutritionist though, I think they should say 'reduce sugars and processed carbs', maybe mention bread and white rice because they're such staples in most people's diets, encourage whole foods and vegetables. And then leave it at that! 

Listing all these specific things to avoid or things to seek out that are expensive or hard to find is just going to overwhelm people at their doctor's appointment! At least at a nutritionist, they're going to give you handouts and take the time to answer your questions on each thing."
Mt-Implausible,2022-05-08,2,"Thanks for the taking the time on the thoughtful response. He is definitely not a nutritionist, I didn't actually know about the BPA one though.

jellyn7,2022-05-08,2,"I did some more thinking about this while I was making dinner. And how it's the 80/20 rule.

You can notice it right away in your readings if you drink soda versus water! I defy anyone to notice the change from one type of eggs to another. 

Making a bunch of small tweaks like picking out cage free versus free range versus omega-3 eggs might be something some people are really into! But MOST people are just going to want to know what're the big things they can do to see results.

buzzybody21,2022-05-15,3,Dude. Heres the door. This guys in the hospital. Theyre not asking for your dangerous advice.
Lausannea,2022-05-15,1,"This is exceptionally unsafe advice. Please don't put people at risk by recommending unsafe behaviors.

You're free to manage your own diabetes as you wish, but ensure your recommendations follow safe practice standards."
Boring_Huckleberry62,2022-05-14,5,"No!  You can have ketones regardless of glucose levels even in mid 100's.  So no, don't just take more insulin.
Myself, T1 56yrs.  Never had ketones till 6 months ago.  Intestinal issues, was hardly eating.  Usually eat 175gr carbs daily, was down to about 25.  Sugar levels 100 to 160 entire day had trace to small.  So in my case, starvation ketones. Nothing that 2gal of water in 4hrs couldn't handle.  
Ketones are a by-product of burning fat for energy."
DevilMezzo,2022-05-14,4,"I also was never in the hospital for DKA, but my doc recently warned me about it and told me some stuff I was never told.
To sum it up, when you have a high sugar for a long time and your body goes into DKA, it produces some stuff that keeps you running without insulin.
However, this stuff makes you insulin resistent.
And that goes in a spiral, as the blood sugar rises and you get more and more resistent, dehydrated and sick.

And yes, the correct approach would be to take more insulin you usually would, which is kind of risky as you could easily fall asleep while on DKA and get a serious hypo.
Also the DKA may last a bit after glucose is in normal range.
If the DKA gets so bad, that you are to sick to actually take care of yourself, you should absolutely go to the hospital."
Lausannea,2022-05-15,3,"Some of the advice given isn't... ideal.

The body can burn fat for fuel, which produces ketones. Ketones by themselves aren't dangerous, but in high amounts they make your body acidic. (Which is why it's ketoacidosis, in diabetics it's known as diabetic ketoacidosis aka DKA.)

This can happen either from a lack of insulin, or a lack of food for a prolonged period of time. People who are ill are also more likely to develop ketones in response to being ill, which can escalate into DKA more easily when vomiting and being unable to keep food down for example. Couple excessive ketosis with dehydration and you're in serious trouble.

This is why the main steps to avoid or deal with DKA are:

1. Drink plenty of water, basically sip water every 10-15 minutes minimum.
2. Consume some carbs.
3. Take insulin for said carbs.

The purpose of the carbs and insulin is to ensure your body stops the ketosis process. The hydration is to ensure your blood isn't too thick from dehydration, which makes the acid concentration higher, and to help flush ketones out by encouraging urination.

If ketones don't go down after a few hours, or you're unable to keep water down (including liquid carbs), that's a good indication you need to go to the hospital. If you're unable to self-treat the above 3 steps, you need medical help.

High glucose is a side-effect of lack of insulin, but it's not necessary to go into ketoacidosis. Prolonged starvation can trigger it as well, which is often known as euglycemic DKA (eDKA).

When in doubt, *always* call a doctor, explain the situation to them, and ask their advice."
hiding-identity23,2022-05-15,2,"Early DKA can be managed and resolved at home IF you know what youre doing and are experienced. But after a certain point, the hospital is absolutely necessary or you will die, not might&WILL. 

For me (and this is not medical advice&always consult your doctor), once I realize Im heading into DKA territory, my first steps are to take insulin by injection based on my BG (but a little more because you tend to be more resistant in DKA), change my pump site, and potentially change my pump cartridge if I have any reason to think the insulin may have gone bad. 

Then, over the next several hours, I try to drink as much water as I can keep down to flush out the ketones. I check BG every hour or two (finger stick, I dont rely on my CGM for this) and may give more insulin if I dont feel Im starting to come down like I think I should. But I dont give nearly as much to prevent stacking and dropping low later. And if I can keep any kind of carbs down, I try to do that and cover with insulin. Insulin is the biggest thing needed to combat the ketones&even if youre actually at good numbers, in which case you have to get carbs into you somehow so you can safely take insulin. If you are at a reasonable BG but cant get carbs into you, then you need the hospital to get a dextrose drip to offset the needed insulin. 

Fun fact: When a non-diabetic develops acidosis, they still use insulin to treat it. Of course thats with the dextrose to prevent lows."
hiding-identity23,2022-05-14,10,"Update? Im curious if it was DKA. With only small to moderate ketones and no vomiting yet, Im thinking either not DKA or caught very early. 

Did something happen that you werent getting insulin or insulin or a pump site went bad?"
anderson1496,2022-05-14,9,"So the doctor ended up saying that it wasnt DKA but that my sodium was low and I was dehydrated. Kinda strange to me that I would be feeling the way I did if it wasnt more serious. And I always drink a lot of water each day.

hiding-identity23,2022-05-15,1,"No, you dont drop into a coma out of nowhere. Most describe it as feeling like a stomach flu early on. Even before that, you probably will have high BG (but not necessarily) and the symptoms that typically go along with that. And you likely will be spilling ketones (though they can take a couple hours to make it into your urine, so they could be starting to build up in your blood before you test positive on a urine dip). 

For me, I start to just feel sort of nonspecifically crummy which gets worse and worse until the nausea sets in along with abdominal pain. Then that gets worse until you start vomiting. And the vomiting gets worse. Eventually you have nothing, not even bile left in you and then you have bouts of dry heaving every 5-10 minutes. 

After a certain point, you may feel short of breath and have a rapid breathing pattern (you can Google Kussmaul breathing to see what that looks like). And your breath may have a fruity smell to it."

How bad would people describe the stomach pain they have on a scale of 1-10? As far as I know Ive never been in full blown DKA as diagnosed quite early."
hiding-identity23,2022-05-15,2,"Stomach pain easily a 7 or higher, and for fun, mine radiates straight into my back as well. 

Last time I was admitted with DKA, a nurse didnt understand why I was complaining of pain. Tried to tell me DKA doesnt usually cause pain. Thankfully, the doctor happened to come in right then, and I asked him to tell her that it absolutely does. He did, and she tried claiming that wasnt what she said. I know damn well she just thought I was drug seeking."
Big_Load4422,2022-05-15,1,"I had a severe DKA October last year. The stomach pain became a full torso pain. It really hard to describe, but it would be a 10. Everytime I would breathe a little, the whole torso would feel like its being crushed with 1 knife. A sharp crushing pain if you will. So yeah stomach pain is bad"

 &gt;U.S. health expenditure as percent of GDP 1960-2020
Published by Jenny Yang, Jan 4, 2022
In 2020, U.S. national health expenditure as a share of its gross domestic product (GDP) reached an all time high of 19.7%. The United States has the highest health spending based on GDP share among developed countries. Both public and private health spending in the U.S. is much higher than other developed countries.

&gt;Why the U.S. pays so much more

&gt;While private health spending in Canada stays at around three percent and in Germany under two percent of the gross domestic product, it is nearly nine percent in the United States. Another reason for high costs can be found in physicians salaries, which are much higher in the U.S. than in other wealthy countries. A general practitioner in the U.S. earns nearly twice as much as the average physician in other high-income countries. Additionally, medicine spending per capita is also significantly higher in the United States. Finally, inflated health care administration costs are another of the predominant factors which make health care spending in the U.S. out of proportion. It is important to state that Americans do not pay more because they have a higher health care utilization, but mainly because of higher prices.

&gt;Expected developments

&gt;By 2028, it is expected that health care spending in the U.S. will reach nearly one fifth of the nations gross domestic product. Or in dollar-terms, health care expenditures will accumulate to about 6.2 trillion U.S. dollars in total.

Now if you can get everyone in the country to take half of their normal salaries, the doctors might get on board of single payer."

We can sweeten the pot by forgiving loans for medical school and eliminating the expenses incurred by insurance billing offices, administrative oversight, etc., but, ultimately, I  propose to not give them a choice. 

Well, I suppose they could go practice in some privately-funded quackery somewhere, giving people coffee enemas... But I would like to assume that they don't want to live in a third-world shithole where they regularly consign people to a slow, agonizing death because wE cAn'T aFfOrD iT and people break into drugstores for insulin.

ew73,2022-04-25,18,"If you can't return them, the only thing you can do is use them.

CGMs are moving generally toward prescription coverage instead of medical supply.  It actually tends to cost less for most patients.  However, you have to deal with 3rd party suppliers.

Going foward, today, contact, in order:

* Anthem, verify the pharmacy that will cover your Dexcom supplies.  It's probably Express-Scripts or Walgreens or similar.  Get the name.
* Contact your doctor.  Have them write a new prescription and send it to the pharmacy you discovered above for a 90-day supply.  This will be a mail-order supply, and may take a little while to process.

After that, simply wait for the EoB from Anthem -- either download it from their website if you have one, or wait for the physical copy.  On the back, there is a dispute process.  **Follow it to the letter.**  You will probably be denied a couple times, until you get to the external arbiter.  

Just keep explaining that you'd love to use the benefits, but they failed to properly notify you.  The claim should be covered under prescription coverage. 

In the mean time, use those sensors.  US Med won't take them back, so."

Even then, Kroger had their own copay card where the sensors were $42 pr sensor they applied to my account u til the Prior Authorization went through. 

When I got pregnant at the beginning of the year my PCP wanted to switch me to Dexcom. BCBS refuses to cover unless I have a ""significant medical issue"" stemming from Libre use."

Do one thing wrong and nothing works and you have to start over. I was recently diagnosed with T2 and doctor gave me a sample dexcom. Loved it and it helped me figure things out without so many finger pricks. Unfortunately our insurance only covers CGMs for those T2s that use insulin (which makes no sense to me if control and prevention of advancement of the disease is the goal). Anyways I looked into the other CGMs and found freestyle libre 2 to be much more reasonable out of pocket. I get ir from my hospital pharmacy and its $85 ever 2 weeks, so about 2500 a year. Much more affordable then dexcom. There are also accessories that can turn it into a dexcomm with continuous feeds to your phone instead of scanning. Hope this helps!"

Since our pool is so large, we have much better coverage than my husband does who works for a medium sized company.

BCBS, $1500 deductible, $5650 out of pocket.  I meet the out of pocket tomorrow when I have hand surgery.  Between deductible and out of pocket, I pay 20, they pay 80.

Full price for 30 days of Dexcom G6 is $338.24.   Though my doctor writes the script to replace them after 7 days.   After my deductible, I paid $67.67, and for the rest of the year, everything will have no copay."

In a vacuum, your country is a failed state in many, many, many ways and the only way to fix it is for the masses of lazy apathetic people to start saying enough is enough.  What will cause that?  dunno.  Will it ever happen?  unlikely.

OP, if you're seriously frustrated and it's impacting your QOL as much as I think it is I highly suggest you move to a 1st world country in Europe or even Canada.

fellow_earthican,2022-04-26,3,What is the real truth about Canadian healthcare?

whoisearth,2022-04-26,2,"In Canada we do the same triage as everywhere else.  Yes there will always be exceptions but for the gross majority of problems if you need urgent care there is no waiting list.

When people on both sides of the border complain it's usually because they're entitled shitheads that think their gallstones are more important than chemo for a child.

On that note, as a parent when you take a child to the hospital they do not fuck around.  You get seen posthaste unless it's painfully obvious, again, that you're an entitled shithead who thinks your kids snuffles are more important than someone losing consciousness.

So yeah, for the vast majority of the times you need the healthcare system you're fine.  Is it perfect?  Fuck no.  But it's lightyears ahead of America.

Go back to quality of life.  Sure I pay more in taxes and maybe my job doesn't pay as much but I'm not wasting my life playing bullshit games with hospitals and insurance companies or losing my job and going out of coverage or the litany of other things.

I'd advise you to take the time to go to a doctor/hospital and get it checked, they might be able to tell you why it bruised so bad, or give you guidance on how to avoid that in the future. Maybe it was the placement, maybe you hit it on something and the position shifted - try to avoid the spot on the other side too, and if you have any gels for the bruising, apply it regurarely. There's not much more to say, I wish you all the best in the future with your new Dexcom. One question though: (sorry, I'm not a Dexcom user, so I have no personal experience with it specifically, so if this a dumb question, please enlighten me) wouldn't it be practical to have a reserve at home? Even if you'd have to pay with your own money, in case something happens on a holiday, or shipment is very slow, having one in reserve would come in real handy, and you could still call support and ask for a replacement - in case of medical gadgets, it's never bad to be safe"
Lausannea,2022-05-24,13,"Usually we have a stash of sensors, but they're expensive, so when one fails prematurely we typically call for replacements. Not because we're out, but because we didn't get full use out of it and it means we'll be short at the end of our supply period."

So: you insert a sensor, click in the transmitter, after 10 days you click out the transmitter, take off the sensor and throw the used sensor out. Then you put a new sensor on and click the transmitter back into it.

Whereas with the Libre it's a whole package every sensor lol. But yeah, people who use Dexcom definitely stock up on sensors just like we do with Libres."
rosepetalsandkisses,2022-05-24,4,"Thanks for educating me! I wasn't so sure, since OP's answers suggested they didn't have a new sensor in reserve, but good to know :)"
Lausannea,2022-05-25,2,"It's possible that someone's financial situation/healthcare insurance plan doesn't let them stock up, yeah. :( I think the average Dexcom user who goes through insurance gets a 1-3 month supply at a time through a supplier, meaning there's typically some stock of sensors, but exceptions definitely exist!"
harrystylesmistress,2022-05-24,1,im a broke college student!!!!!>r unfortunately i cannot afford extra supplies
MISTERDIEABETIC,2022-05-24,1,"You can even call Freestyle and tell them a sensors adhesive failed like a day early, give them the Serial # and the dates it was worn. Then they'll send you a replacement and you won't even have to send the old one in as they only want sensors returned if there was a failure and wasn't able to be scanned. 

I've had to get a lot of sensors replaced and glad I found out early that I wasn't SOL if one failed (literally days after starting on their 1st gen 10 day sensors I was across the country for work and the one I was already wearing failed, and the replacement I brought as a just in case also failed so they gave me the necessary insurance info to get a replacement at a local CVS) 
There were times that I'd just stack ones to be replaced and would call in like 8 at a time. Though this took like 2 hours on the phone with a call center in India and the language barrier made it take much longer than it needed to. 
But after about a year on their first 14 day sensors, I have had a sensor failure in quite a while and the adhesive has gotten a hell of a lot better! But I do occasionally bump my arm into the corner of a wall and accidentally rip the sensor off, but I'll still call in replacements for those anyways seeing as I've had to pay out of pocket for 5 years now and I'm pretty sure I've paid enough $ to get a few extra for free lol"

andr01dv2,2022-05-24,28,"Thats an old wives tale. Do not put food on wounds.

[Rest the bruised area, if possible.

Ice the bruise with an ice pack wrapped in a towel. Leave it in place for 10 to 20 minutes. Repeat several times a day for a day or two as needed.

Compress the bruised area if it is swelling, using an elastic bandage. Don't make it too tight.

Elevate the injured area.

If your skin isn't broken, you don't need a bandage. Consider taking an over-the-counter pain reliever if needed.

Lausannea,2022-05-24,2,"&gt;Bleeders are readers

I know this is a common saying, but it really isn't true. The enzymes on the filament are designed to measure glucose in the interstitial fluid, not in the blood, so even if it was reading from the blood they... don't actually work that way. The blood can also end up clotting around the filament which then leads to a failed sensor that gets no more data.

The failure rate on bleeders is relatively high.

Someone somewhere started this mantra but it doesn't make sense and a lot of people with bleeders have to pull them early, regardless of the sensor (Dexcom, Libre, Guardian etc.)"

4thshift,2022-05-20,15,"Welcome to the support group. 

Hydration with water and lower-carb food works for a lot of people. Moderate walks in a safe environment, to get your circulation systems working better and your muscles soaking up the excess glucose. 

Cut sugars and eat food that looks like actual food more than processed stuff: the crud full of added sugars, and starches that have been removed from the fibers, and deep dunked in vegetable oils (aka seed oils). None of the crap is deadly on its own, but the cumulative effect is high and sustained glucose levels, and all over inflammation, and damage to every body part.

Ask your doctor why you have diabetes  the underlying cause and Type, and how you might test to be sure. 

If he doesnt have time to talk to you much, schedule a visit with a certified diabetes educator for a more personable intro. There is plenty of terrific info on YouTube about different methodologies, about metabolism and and food/exercise; but a lot of garbage too, about cures and spices and juices  skip the latter; look at lots of different ideas. If you get any medication, read about it and dont just take your doctors instructions as all you need to know. You can deal with this just fine. You might feel off repeatedly as your glucose levels change, hopefully for the better overall."
nomnom2001,2022-05-20,9,"A little easy list 

- Cut sugared drinks (All of them) 
(No sugar drinks with sweetners are fine but they can cause stomachaches for some people)
- Try to increase ur daily movement 
(Standing desk, walking to work atleast a bit, walks, workouts anything that fits into your schedule) 
- try to cut carbs where you can
(Maybe only eggs for breakfast, and avoid toasts, pastery &amp; cereal.)
- opt for whole grain options when you cant avoid carbs 
- avoid junk food &amp; sweets obviously

Theres a lot of other stuff as well but if you follow this it should make a sizeable dent in the problem. 

Take it step by step maybe try to introduce 1-2 changes a week to not get overwhelmed

Reading a book or two about or informing yourself obviously also helps

Good luck"
in_the_sheyd,2022-05-20,5,Wait& you were 350mg/dl and the doctor prescribed diet and exercise?!
garbagegirl81,2022-05-20,3,"Yes 
They wanted to put me on metformin but I asked if could wait 3 weeks 

I have an appointment scheduled for June 2nd 

If it hasn't improved, I get the meds"
in_the_sheyd,2022-05-20,5,"You might be able to taper off medications once youre stabilized but prolonged hyperglycemia causes something called glucose toxicity which makes insulin resistance much worse. To be honest if I took a fasting blood glucose of 350 Id be spending the day in the ER.

You should be talking to your doctor about using insulin at least for a while. A lot of T2 diabetics need insulin at diagnosis before stopping it once things are more stable."
younghannahg,2022-05-21,3,"I have type 1, so could be different. But my blood sugar was 601 when I found out I had diabetes, and my doctor told me for the first couple of weeks to try to keep it at 300 for a couple of weeks. Or my body would have revolted because it was used to being really high. 

 Even now, I very rarely notice a high without checking it. Some people's bodies do not react much to high blood sugar... At least not visibly, I understand internally it would be freaking out."
thatawesomeperson98,2022-05-20,2,Agreed. I was diagnosed at 217 in 2015 and my dr said any higher and i wouldve been immediately put on insulin
ImportantDelivery852,2022-05-21,2,"Cut out carb immediately, may be 20g a day and check yout blood sugar. Also go for a fast walk after meal. I was diagnosed with 280 fasting. two weeks after my fasting were at 120 ish. My A1C dropped from 13 to 5.6 in 4 month. Dont panic, dont make yourself depressed or anxious which makes liver release more sugar. Avoid stress, eat healthy and real food. Good luck."

I dont know my A1c but i dont know, something doesnt seem right. Should I demand more testing? Which tests? Im so overwhelmed and now I dont know what to eat because I hear jardiance and low carb are recipes for ketoacidosis&"
younghannahg,2022-05-21,4,"I would double check to see if you may have a different type of diabetes. I do not remember what test this is, but I would look into getting tested for what type you have.  Some people are misdiagnosed with type 2 diabetes - especially later on in life. 

Type 1 diabetes cannot be treated with diet and exercise alone, so that is where my brain went. Of course, it could be something else."
MuttonDelmonico,2022-05-21,3,"100% this. Yes, demand more tests. Rule out Type 1 diabetes."
ImportantDelivery852,2022-05-21,1,"You need to know your A1C, that is the base line. Also get a meter from walmart to keep track of fasting."
TXTarheel,2022-05-20,4,"Get a meter &amp; test, test, test to see how different foods affect your blood sugars.  Eat as few carbs as possible and stay hydrated.  If you feel up to it get at some moderate exercise daily.   You will have to find the low carb way of eating that works best for you.  If it is not sustainable, you hate what you are eating,etc you will fail. I've failed several times due to trying to eat that way.  I still take a week at least every 6 weeks &amp; record every bite I eat &amp; take my blood sugar two hours afterwards.  I want to make sure my overall diet is still good - is something spiking me that I would not expect.

Meds are not the end of the world.  I'm taking metformin &amp; long-acting insulin which help me keep good numbers (last A1C was 5.6) along with eating lower carb (30-50grams per day), 30-45 minutes of walking per day &amp; staying hydrated.  I consider these meds a tool in my toolbox to healthy blood sugars.  I would love to see enough control to drop the insulin because who really enjoys giving themselves a shot."
LeiLaniGranny,2022-05-20,3,"6 Months ago my Blood Glucose was 350 and A1C was 11.5. Yesterday was 1st time seeing Diabetes Educator and my Glucose was 204 (fasting) and A1C 6.1. She was amazed I am where I am with no medication for diabetes. I tried Metformin at the beginning but 4 days into it I was in so much stomach pain I couldn't eat or get out of bed. Stopped taking it and won't go on it again.
I stopped eating foods with flour and all products with processed wheat or flour. 
No sugar including in products ingredients list.
I learned to eat eggs every way you can make them as that lowers my glucose to normal range during the day.
I eat lots of nuts for snacks.
Research and log foods you eat  wait 2 hrs do a reading. If high eliminate items and you'll get to know what works that way. 
I also follow Diabetes 101 Facebook group who are great help."
DogKnowsBest,2022-05-20,3,"I had a Dr's appointment a week after having the blood draw.  My doctor asked me if I had ever had a stroke. I said no. He asked if I ever had a heart attack. I said no. He asked me if I knew I was diabetic. I said no.

My blood glucose levels were 487 and my A1C was 14.1.  My cholesterol was out of whack and my blood pressure was high.  Every of vital and blood marker was perfect.  I was 54 years old, 158 lbs and 6' tall.  I was in the best shape of my life; supposedly.

We set a plan. He put me on 1000mg of Metformin and 25mg of Jardiance.  I changed my eating habits. I got more sleep. I really cut unnecessary carbs out of my diet quickly.  In 90 days, I had my fasting blood sugar down to 130 and my A1C was 6.8.  Ninety days after that, I was down to 1 Metformin a day and 25mg of Jardiance and my A1C was 6.3.

I am completely off of Metformin and take Jardiance and Glipizide.  I have reintroduced a few things back into my diet to make my life of eating fewer carbs but maintaining my sanity much more doable.  I lost down to 146 lbs which really works well for my body type.  Life as a managing diabetic isn't so horrible.  Insulin is nowhere in my immediate future and quite likely nowhere close.  I eat better; am still in even better shape than before, and I stay comfortably in the mid-6's for A1C.  My cholesterol is perfect; BP is actually now more low'ish than high'ish and I do everything that I want (except eat tons of unnecessary carbs.  

I started loosely following a KETO diet; and over the past year have transformed into KETOvore.  

It's not the end of the world and don't let others convince you otherwise.

Education is the name of the game. There's no better time in the history of mankind to be diabetic. There are more treatments, more carb-friendly foods to eat, and new medications are being researched all the time.

If your primary doesn't specialize in diabetes (I was lucky that my GP did), ask for a referral to speak to a doctor with that specialty.  You got this!"

Hagaros,2022-05-21,1,"When I was first diagnosed everything pretty much sucked until I had a better understanding of insulin to carb ratio.

PM_ME_YOUR_DND_SHEET,2022-05-20,2,"Get as much information as you can, ask any questions you may have. I'd recommend getting with a dietician to learn how to count carbs and how many you should have each day.

I know everyone is different, and have different views about medication, but honestly I am glad for my Metformin. I started at an A1C of 9.5 and 200 bg level at the hospital. Here I am ~8 months later, down 20% of my initial weight and an A1C of 4.8 as of Thursday."
marleymo,2022-05-21,2,"Even if you take some meds now to get your numbers down, you dont have to take them for life. It might be worth it to get the pet scan ASAP? 

I got mine down from a similar range very quickly by temporarily cutting out all grains, potatoes, sugar, anything high on the glycemic index, anything made of flour. Dropping drastically can suck because you get false lows. I was exhausted and felt like crap those first few weeks but then it evened out. 

Getting cancer and diabetes at the same time, wtf. That doesnt seem right at all."

captian_insulin,2022-05-21,2,"358 was the high for my type 1 as well but, I'm not versed in type 2 so it may be high for type 2 ignoring the rule of 80 - 130 being a healthy number for non-diabetic. Focus on what you can do, listen to your doc, ask questions and take a break because those numbers do take drain you long or short term. I hope the best for you."
garbagegirl81,2022-05-21,1,Thank you:)
WildIris2021,2022-05-21,2,"Do not figure it as a failure if you need meds. Diabetes is as genetic as it is lifestyle. If youve got it, youve got it. I waited extra years before I agreed to try Victoza. It was just getting worse each year. No matter what I ate. Finally started Victoza and it was like I was normal again. Metformin actually has benefits beyond diabetes. Its a good thing. 

Change your diet  NOW. Cut the carbs significantly. Zero added sugars. Use Splenda and Stevia or whatever sugar alternative you like. 

Remember that carbs include grains like flour, corn and rice. Wheat flour &amp; corn send my blood sugar sky high. I cant eat a sandwich and have reasonable numbers. Just beware. Fill in the gaps with veggies. Berries are low carb. Dont eliminate a food group but its time to massively moderate carbs. A continuous glucose meter is a PIA but also life changing. 

Make the changes but dont beat yourself up for taking meds. Instead congratulate yourself for caring for yourself."

AKJangly,2022-05-21,1,"Your pancreas produces insulin but also stores it. 

I'm t1 LADA with over 90% of my insulin producing beta cells dead. I don't make enough insulin to stay alive. But with extremely tight control over several weeks, I store up enough insulin to...

...

Make my pancreas go kamikaze on my body because I ate a fun sized candy.

If you don't need to inject insulin, your pancreas won't try to kill you like it tries to kill me every month.

Take a couple of weeks to let your pancreas build up a good supply of insulin. Ketogenic/low carbohydrate diet, lots of low intensity exercise like walking, swimming, biking, etc. You will lower your insulin requirements and your blood sugar will return to normal range within a couple of weeks. Make a habit out of these things.


It doesn't even have to be long. Take 15 minutes to get a jog in and you'll be boosting your insulin sensitivity for the next 24 hours.

If you can stick to this, you will be able to safely reward yourself with even the tastiest of treats once or twice per month.

I'm not your doctor though and you'll want to confirm that with your doctor, as everyone is a little different.

I work with two other T1 diabetics, one who pretends he's normal and ended up in DKA a month ago, another who is also LADA like myself and takes finger sticks. I work with half a dozen T2 diabetics as well. One of the guys was diagnosed at 1200mg/dL as a T2 and has since gotten off insulin. Crazy how great diet and exercise can treat you.

I just wish T1 was that easy."

4 oz frozen strawberries

4 oz frozen banana (overripe bananas from the store are the best peel them before freezing them)

8 fluid oz. of milk (could be any liquid)

I do this four times a week.

The fruit is measured in weight.  I put all the frozen stuff in the blender and blend it.  The frozen banana gives it the consistency and texture of soft serve ice cream.  I eat it out of a bowl with a spoon.

Eeazymane,2022-05-19,4,I was at the gym and it beeped saying I was at 59 and going lower but it had got snagged on a machine before and started to come off. Luckily I had a new one at home.
tajodo42,2022-05-18,3,I was between 70-LO for 24 hours. No matter what I ate. Replaced the sensor and It read 128 =D
i-d-even-k-,2022-05-19,2,In cases like these always have a meter close to check by hand that the sensor is showing fine.

graedus29,2022-05-19,2,Couldn't agree more. Not worth the frustration even factoring in the no-fuss replacement of bad sensors. My breaking point was replacing a sensor that went bad after one day with a second one that went bad after one hour. I'd rather stick my finger.
WildIris2021,2022-05-19,1,"Yep. Ive had that happen. Many times. And each time that it goes bad not only do I have to spend too much time talking to an absolutely disinterested customer service representative. Then, for me to get an immediate replacement I need to drive 15 miles, which, in traffic easily takes 35-40 minutes each direction.

AKJangly,2022-05-19,-1,"Blood sugar doesn't suddenly fall off a cliff like that. Insulin takes a few minutes to ramp up it's intensity, and the ISF that the Libre reads lags behind blood sugar by 10-15 minutes so the sharp drops and peaks that you see here literally don't exist. The graph is made up.

The current reading, however, is not. Third party transmitter like MiaoMiao and Bubble can scan the sensor every five minutes and transmit the data to your phone to be graphed, so it can show waves so accurate you can perform calculus to predict blood sugar values fifteen minutes ahead of time.

Or you could just get a dexcom. But insurance doesn't always cover it, if you actually have insurance."
i-d-even-k-,2022-05-19,5,"It absolutely does fall off cliffs, if you do a high enough basal and have times of day when the insulin resistance is lower."
Zouden,2022-05-19,2,You're correct that this isn't a real chart of blood sugar. But it is a real chart. This is what happens when a Libre sensor comes off. Happened to me last week. OP says their sensor was snagged on a machine at the gym.

AKJangly,2022-04-30,18,"Bad advice here. Body isn't asking for exercise, it's asking for insulin. Exercise might shoot sugars over 300.

Edit: downvoting doesn't change the inherent danger of exercising with insufficient insulin. That's a common recipe for DKA.

OP needs to be cautious. And if you're sick, the last thing your body wants is exercise. It wants recovery."

adult_hiter,2022-05-01,2,"Dont do that, inject more insuline drink a lot of water and keep a normal eating pattern, its common that your bloodugar levels are high when sick, but the last thing you need to do right now is exercize.

If you excercize you could get keto acidoze (dutch word) 

It basicly means that your fat is starting to melt becouse of the high sugarlevel and that fat is poisining your body and exercizing would also Burn even more fat so you would poison your own body even faster, yes excircize would lower your bloodsugar but you wil be poisining yourself in the progress and give yourself keto acidoze.

So more insuline to lower your sugar
Drink more water this wil get rid of the keto acidose
And dont fucking excercize just netflix and chill or something (but leave out the chill becouse that is also excercize)

And no im not a docter but i often do this with good resuls when my sugar is high"

Also curious why you didn't leave this on the top comment as their advice was the same?"
Manners_BRO,2022-04-30,4,"Agreed take more insulin, the only time I wouldn't is if you can't keep something down.  If you can stomach soda and carbs just keep a soda near you if you drop lower."
AKJangly,2022-04-30,3,It's also my personal experience on a monthly basis. OP needs to listen to their doctor because it's very common for diabetics to be in this boat.
vastmagick,2022-04-30,10,"Hydrate, if you are sick it will help fighting off DKA and being properly hydrated can help lower your blood sugar.  And most importantly, as has been mentioned by others, listen to your doctor.  They know infinitely more about you than strangers on the internet."

malajni,2022-04-30,1,Ok thanks
AKJangly,2022-04-30,3,"Your doctor is right.

Your body wants the insulin. You *need* it. And it is a *lot* of insulin that your body needs right now.

Your standard correction dosing is going to cause a little dip, then it will go right back up. Your body is using it up and waiting for more.

Start with your usual correction dose, and keep adding insulin to it every time you correct again. Inject intramuscularly and massage the area to double or triple the uptake rate so you can inject again in less time.

And most importantly: keep a lot of hypo drinks around and pay constant attention to that number. You're gonna be ravaging through insulin, and once your body has enough, the insulin resistance will be gone in a flash. You *will* be chugging juice.

Don't ever take large doses without juice or candy on standby. That's my medical advice. Everything else is  personal experience that seems to correlate to OP.

I seem to get sick like this every month, so I'm used to crazy high correction doses."
Wadsworth739,2022-04-30,3,"My 7 year old currently has a cold. Despite correct calculations for food intake, he runs 200+. While we are all new to this, we are not freaking out as of yet.   The cold is the current problem his body is trying to fight. We just have to support his other functions via insulin as needed."
MadBliss,2022-04-30,3,"1. Rest. Please do not exercise when you have a fever. An elevated temperature increases your metabolic demands, making DKA more likely. Same goes with exercising when you have very high sustained sugars (over 300mg/dl).

2. Your doc suggested increasing insulin. Are you on a pump? If so, increase basal by 10-20%. If on multiple daily injections or a daily one time injection of long acting, do not adjust your long acting. Only increase your coverage ratio by 10-20%. If on a cgm, still check finger sticks every hour even if covering every 4 or 5 hours. Your capillary blood sugar level (what you get from finger sticks) are the most efficient way to see your ""real"" glucose when blood work isn't available. This will help you prevent lows when your body gets back to normal.

3. Increase fluid intake, optimally 20oz/hr. 

4. Check for ketones every time you pee."
johnnydirnt,2022-04-30,2,"When you're sick, your body does many things to compensate. In my experience, my glucose levels stay elevated and NOTHING i do brings it down. Talk to your endocrinologist if you have concerns. If you're not feeling any side effects from an elevated blood sugar, don't worry about it. take your insulin as normal. If your blood sugar stays elevated after your temperature returns to normal/other symptoms subside, get back in touch with your doctor.  


I'm not a doctor but this is how it was explained to me."
WoefulHC,2022-04-30,2,"Does your doctor's advice make sense? To me it does. How much insulin we need is GOING to vary. Both having a high blood glucose\* and being sick tend to mean we need more.  Having ketones present will also do this. These effects do reinforce each other. 

So.... being sick may mean you need (for example) 10% more. Having ketones present may mean 20% more. Being above 275 may mean 15% more. I don't expect those three together to be 45% more. I expect them to be about 52% more. I also expect this adjustment to be similar for both basal (long acting) and bolus (short acting) though the exact increase may differ between them. If you are taking steroids that also tends to increase insulin needs. (In some cases by 200%+.) Hormonal changes can also have a noticeable impact. Sometimes we don't/can't figure out exactly why the needed dose changed. 

TLDR: If bg is high and it hasn't come down and you are past the peak window, it is time for more insulin. It may also be a good idea to consider something (like mild aerobic exercise or a warm shower) to help increase your insulin sensitivity.

\*by this I mean if when you are at 120 mg/dl 1u will decrease your bg by 80 mg/dl then if you at 275 mg/dl it may only decrease it by 60 mg/dl with 1u of insulin. In my case between 275 and 325 I need \~50% more and above 325 I usually need double."

hockeyfan1998,2022-05-01,2,"I go through this a lot, almost every day. A quick walk always helps preferably up hill. Be careful though if you have ketones the walk may negatively impact you.

Sometimes my blood sugar shoots up to 340 if i eat something bad. I have to take around 27 units of humalog for 110g carbs. I change my injection spots every time, its kind of strange."

svedka666,2022-04-30,1,"If you're sick, that'll probably make it higher. I've had it happen before. Like others said though, only ways to keep it down is hydration, exercise, and more insulin. Pump site could be off too so might wanna give it a try."

NnQM5,2022-04-30,1,"Could be stress related. Anything that increases cortisol levels (general stress, lack of sleep, anxiety, caffeine, rigorous exercise, etc.) can result in higher sugars than normal. I usually do a little extra insulin throughout the day when that is the case for me."

So I would have to go to the expense 100% out of pocket for at least one cycle to prove Dexcom doesnt work for me. How many folks are willing to dump $400 on proving they cant use something when even if I had good reasons, they could still say no? So I just pay the $75/mo for the Libre rather than pay the $400 for the covered Dexcom. 

The fact is my Rx insurance wants to pay for none of it, and are just making it very difficult to discourage claims."

php857,2022-05-24,1,How much does it cost ??
cyphersaint,2022-05-24,2,"Prices are going to vary based on insurance. The truth is that if you don't use insulin, your insurance is unlikely to cover it. I've had three different insurance companies, and the last two wouldn't cover any CGM because I don't use insulin. Even with proof that I simply am not compliant with actually doing the finger pricks as often as I should. I would prefer the Dexcom myself since unlike the Libre 2 it transfers the data to your phone. You have to manually read it with the Libre 2. The Libre 2 does have an 8 hour memory, but all too often I will lose data because I forget to read it. From bed time to when I wake up isn't usually more than 8 hours, but I might forget to read my sensor right before bed, or I might forget to read it immediately after waking up. The problem is that the Dexcom costs something like $400/month out of pocket while the Libre2 costs $75/month out of pocket."
ElaborateCantaloupe,2022-05-24,1,Libre 3 works more like a traditional CGM by sending data directly to your phone. Its not available in every country yet - Im in the US and Im hoping its available here soon.
cyphersaint,2022-05-24,1,Same. Hopefully the cost of it doesn't increase with the increase in capabilities.
thatawesomeperson98,2022-05-24,1,Same here i switched from the libre 2 to the 14 day as i had a lot of issues with the 2 hoping the 3 is out soon though
Dfmahone,2022-05-24,1,It costs about 100 bucks Canadian per sensor and they last two weeks. My insurance covers 80%

I wouldn't necessarily recommend them as they aren't built to be life-dependent, so making treatment decisions based on their values might not be a good idea. If you're just keeping an eye on levels throughout the day they may be decent. 

 Check out nutrisense as an example."

Swiftlock,2022-05-24,1,"I use freestyle libre. Ill be honest, the sensors fail  a lot and have inaccuracies at times so its ALWAYS best to double check your sugar when its going low. Sometimes itll be 40-100 off from a finger stick. But call the company and they will usually replace for free. They last 14 days. I had to pay $75 copay for two which'll last me the whole month until i fixed my medicaid as a secondary insurance making the cost $0. You do have to get it perscribed. You'll never get out of having to do finger sticks, but libre or dexcom will reduce it a bunch."
chefdonie,2022-05-24,1,I got a referral from my gp to see a dietitian. The dietitian got my libre link for me which helped make a strong case for my pump to my endo and insurance. I prefer the Dexcom Im on now even though the switch to Dexcom was involuntary due to the pump.
uunderconstruction,2022-05-24,1,honestly anything except for libre. its ass
totallyjaded,2022-05-24,1,"I've been really happy with the Dexcom G6. I usually calibrate it when I put it on, and halfway to when it needs to be replaced, and I'm usually +/- 5 mg/dL from my meter. The AGP is usually +/- 0.3 of my A1C. 

I used the Libre 2 for a while, but found that it was sometimes 20 - 50 mg/dL from my meter, and there's no way to calibrate it. 

I don't think there's a CGM (at least, in the US) that doesn't require a prescription. My insurance company didn't need a prior authorization for the Libre 2, and covered it like a brand-name medication. Up to this year, they covered the Dexcom like DME, so it was $0. Since January, they've covered it like a prescription, so it runs about $40/month."
thatawesomeperson98,2022-05-24,1,I use the libre 14 day and love it . Have had a few minor issues but not as many as i did with libre 2 . I pay out of pocket as insurance wont cover it (they barely cover my strips and even fight me over them from time to time =D) its around $200 at first if you get the reader but after that i pay around $75 per month without insurance
rodtrusty,2022-05-24,1,"I used the Libre and the G6. I can say that the Libre is much more affordable. G6 is 5k and if your insurance is decent, you'll need to cover 20% of it. With insurance it is about $100 a month if you change it every 10 days (at least in my experience)."

The other downsides to Dexcom are the sensor isn't rechargeable (Medtronic was) and the amount of plastic/medical waste the injection device is horrendous. I wish Dexcom would figure out a way to make the insertion device reusable (like Medtronic did) so it wasn't so much plastic going into landfills. 
Maybe one day they'll make a recycling program for them >"
Abject_Pool8596,2022-05-25,1,My Dexcom cost me $150 for 3 sensors and 1 transmitter .

thelastspreadbender,2022-05-24,0,Dexcom G6. Only thing is after about 8 days active it could possibly read your bg with a deviation of about 15-20 points. Its paired with my Omnipod (not looped the 5 comes to me next week) and since Ive used both hand in hand my A1C dropped 3. 7 points and Im in range 91% of the time. Familiarize yourself with a CGM and insulin pump if pricking your fingers is the most of your problem.

Nobody's perfect, and I don't know that I'd want to use the same needle 20 times or more, but it sounds like they have a very good handle on what is going to work for them and what is not, and it is 100% their decision to make.

Imaginary-Bottle-684,2022-05-14,12,"I always change my needles because of the possibility of bacterial backflow into the pen that could cause harm to the remaining insulin. I carry the used needle in the back pocket of my insulin case until I can dispose in a sharps container. Insulin 4x a day, been on insulin for 4 years. 

Lancets, however, I might change them once a day. If I'm travelling I use single use safety lancets that auto cover after initial use. 

I can see why else they might be reusing the pen needles--they can be expensive if paying OOP. One pharmacy quoted me at $50 for a box of pen needles (name brand) and $20 for store brand (both 100 ct.). I get mine on Amazon for $15 for 200 count."

Their management has nothing to do with needle changes. Diabetes is hard. As hell. Many have poor management for a multitude of reasons. Have you asked your partner how theyre doing mentally? If not, I think you should. Theres no advice I can give about management. It took me nearly two decades to finally get on track and it took a cgm, a pump, and a therapist."

Cost isn't a factor as we're in England and everything is free.

Thank you for taking the time to read my post!"
Lausannea,2022-05-15,2,"&gt;As for the laziness I believe this is one of the main drivers for reuse along with not having anything bad happen from doing it to their knowledge.

I want to emphasize that using 'laziness' with a person who's known to have mental health issues makes it actively more difficult to take better care of onself.

Diabetes burnout and diabetic distress are real, tangible mental health conditions. The less stigma we face (aka judgment by loved ones), the easier it is to deal with that in a healthy way.

I live in the Netherlands, insulin and needles are free for me too, but I reuse needles to help *avoid* burnout. Having to find a new needle for every injection when I take up to 8 injections a day becomes a very resource intensive action that interrupts my daily life.

Here's an idea: why don't you take an empty insulin pen that doesn't dial up anymore and gives no insulin whatsoever (triple check this if you follow through on this), a handful of needles, and set timers throughout the day to help remind you to eat something and follow the process of taking insulin? I'm being genuine here by the way, not joking. 

Count your carbs, do the math for your partner's insulin ratio to figure out how much insulin to take, prepare the insulin pen with needle, stick yourself, count to 10, remove the needle from your body, remove the needle from the pen, dispose of it safely, and put everything away again. Do this 4-8 times a day. Do this for 2 weeks.

You will start to realize how utterly inconvenient it is and how much of a disruption it is, and you don't even get to experience the joys of doses not working out, suffering through highs and lows, the interrupted sleep...

The point I'm trying to make is that from the outside looking in, you see  a few actions that need to be done every day. But you don't use any mental capacity to do any of the things we need to do. That's what burns us out. It's not optional to take insulin, but every single injection involves a dozen steps, thinking ahead, planning, interrupting what we do and so forth.

To have to do this every single day for the rest of your life is a lot. That's why a lot of us reuse needles. Not having to do 4 out of 12 steps reduces our mental workload because we don't have to worry about disposing, putting things away, etc.

Is it ideal? No. There's a small risk involved that reusing needles can cause an infection. On the other hand, I've had an infection from a brand new pump infusion set that was worn for less than 2 days after following all the steps I was supposed to, meaning I did everything by the book and still got an infection. There's always a risk, but the risk remains minor, even with reusing needles.

As long as someone knows what the risk is, and they make an informed decision, the bottom line is that they get the insulin into their body, however they can. If that means reusing a needle for a day, a week, or the entire pen, then... that's okay. The alternative is skipping injections. And skipping injections is a lot worse with much higher risks than reusing needles."
j2_0,2022-05-15,1,"Thank you so much for your reply, I would absolutely try this if I wasn't myself needle phobic if I got type 1 I would end up dead very quickly as I can't get close to a needle."
AnotherLolAnon,2022-05-14,6,"When I was on injections I reused syringes until the markings became illigible. I was in college and would eat breakfast in the car and inject into my thigh through my jeans. My syringes were $10 I think for a box of 100? But my parents bought them anyway so cost wasn't an issue. I don't think I ever bought a second box. 

Now I just leave infusion sets in for too long and don't change my lancet every time (though far more often than the average person)."

All_Hail_King_Sheldn,2022-05-14,5,"Should needles be reused? Absolutely not. 

Do I reuse them? No, and yes. I dont reuse the (pen) needle for my lantus at all. I change the needle for the humolog once daily, which is 3-5 injections. I change the needle in the lancet about once every other day (4-7 uses a day), or when it gets painfully dull, whichever comes first. 

I dont have to reuse them, I get the pen needles through the free clinic, and the lancets cost about $2/100. It is simply a mix of lazy and not wanting to waste them, mixed with keeping them in spare just in case."
pancreaticallybroke,2022-05-14,3,"I was on injections for around 15 years and back then we had to pay for our needles. The insulin was free but not the needles for some reason. There were two diabetics in my immediate family and the needles were £10 a box. I was on between 8-12 injections a day. We were a low income family and just couldn't afford to buy boxes and boxes of needles. I always used one needle per pen unless it got bent or blocked. So did my other family member. Even when we got needles on prescription, we carried on doing this out of habit. I'm now on a pump but had to go back on to pens last year for a couple of months. I tried to makesure I used one new needle per day but I often forgot. My other family member will put a new needle on approx once a day. I've also always found new needles to be much more stingy to use that ones that have been used before.

As a compromise, you could suggest that he puts new needles on each morning. I totally agree that having to carry a sharps bin around is a pain in the arse. Ultimately though, it's his choice and his diabetes. There definitely seems to be a split between newly diagnosed and us long timers when it comes to how often we change needles. Some of that may be down to cockyness, the whole nothings happened to me so I don't see the big deal. I'm fairly active within the community and honestly, I've never met a single person that's had issues with reusing needles. Of course that doesn't mean that stuff can't go wrong but if he has mental health issues anyway and he's struggling to manage his diabetes, now may not be the time to be pushing on this issue. It's a risk but it's a very small risk. The average diabetic has to make an extra 180 decisions a day. Having his blood sugar's run as high as they are is a FAR bigger risk than reusing needles. I strongly recommend you pick your battles and back off on this one issue, certainly for now."
bradleywigginscat,2022-05-14,3,"Definitely change needles all the time. I didn't when I was a teenager and now have 4 scars from infections.

StrangerGlue,2022-05-14,3,"In my house, we change needles when we ""hear"" them go into the skin. (It might not be an actual sound but it feels like a sound.)

We are super clean with them, and nothing is actually actually a sterile procedure in the home anyway. (Unless the entire house gets hospital level cleaning at least daily, and we definitely do not.)

It saves us from priming the needles more often, which saves 1 unit of insulin per dose, and that's a couple hundred over the course of the year. 

Ironically, the province covers 3000 needles per year at 100% but supplemental insurance has no coverage for the insulin at all."
Jasonphos,2022-05-15,3,"Everyone reuses needles. Your partner is correct. I usually reuse a needle 5-10 times then go on to a new one. This is not medical advice.

It certainly helps that (nearly) everything diabetes-relatet is free in germany."
Mine_GER,2022-05-14,2,I change it after using it because these things bend so easily and hurt like hell if reused. At least for me they do. I have reused some if I had no other choice but no more than 2 times and like I said this often leaves me in pain

I replace the needles when I start to feel discomfort or the needles bend. Ive had good control and less-than-good control during my diabetes life....needles reuse has not been a factor in my control motivation. That said.....everyone is unique in their diabetes journey, and perhaps OPs concern is that needle reuse is a bigger part of their partners struggle/acceptance of their diagnosis (Ive had my own periods of acceptance struggles, and sometimes you have to work on reconciling the fact youre trying to control an autonomic body function that non-diabetics get to have for free).

DecadeMoon,2022-05-16,2,I would only reuse a needle in an emergency if I didn't have another one. Reusing needles can cause lipohypertrophy.
soninicole33,2022-05-16,2,"If it's all free anyway, please discard used stuff and use fresh stuff!"
MSV34,2022-05-14,1,"Id be waaaaaay more concerned about that horrid blood sugar control than reusing needles. 

I put all my diabetic supplies in a pencil case in my work bag. Its extremely easy. Sounds like your partner is being hella dramatic lol."
nrgins,2022-05-14,1,"I agree with your partner! I do the same thing. And actually, believe it or not, when I finish the pen I would take the needle off the old pen and use it on a new pen, and do that for two or three pens! Eventually got to the point where I realized that the needle was getting to dull and it was hurting my skin. So I started changing the needle with each new pen. But yeah, I definitely don't change it each time.

Also, when a pen is used up there's about 10 to 15 units left in the pen that you can't get out. So I use a syringe to get that last bit out. And I use the same syringe over and over again.

Don't ask me about my lancet! I think it's been about 10 years since I changed my lancet! LOL"
hiding-identity23,2022-05-14,1,I was only briefly on pens. I used syringes for a couple years then went on a pump. I often reused syringes. Still sometimes do when I do need to take a shot for some reason. Lancets&I change them when they start hurting too bad. Theres a running joke in the diabetes community that you only change your lancet when we change the clocks.

[https://i.imgur.com/LEr3o.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/LEr3o.jpg)

I used to use the same needle until it was too blunt to use. Nowadays I change it after 3 or 4 uses. It's important to rotate the injection sites too."
leezardmik,2022-05-14,1,"Type one for 40+ years. There was a time in my younger days when my whole family was just one step away from homeless. My mom and I both type one, we would get a pack of 10 syringes and it would last for months between the 2 of us. I'd use the same syringe over and over until it was so dull it was painful.   We did this for years."
greatbritishmabbott,2022-05-14,1,"I change mine every time. Like you say they dont cost anything, I probably inject 7-8 times a day and that many needles is easy to carry with the pens and dispose of at home. My brother has it too and I know he doesnt, which I tell him he should but people do what they want. Id hope if it caused an issue people would reconsider"
MyEpicWood,2022-05-14,1,"I change my needles every time, I dont have to inject that much though. Now finger stick needles, I just change those when they start hurting."
NonSequitorSquirrel,2022-05-14,1,"Not changing the needle isn't ideal but many if not most of us are pretty lazy about that sort of thing.

The bigger issue is they're not taking enough insulin and running way too high."
cantstopwontstopGME,2022-05-14,1,As long as they arent sharing the needle then theyre gonna be aight
PastelPainter829,2022-05-14,1,"I reuse a sharp or pen needle 2-3 times.  Once it starts to hurt going in, I change it."
BlackTransGoldberg,2022-05-14,1,infections are not something you want.
1dad1kid,2022-05-14,1,"When I was on a daily injection, I changed every time, but I also have an ""old school"" nurse background so am probably hypercautious."
princessdracos,2022-04-27,4,"My boyfriend is in the early stages of learning about diabetes since he's never really been around a diabetic before.

So now I'm telling you great job! Yay! Keep up the awesome work!"

My kids were worried when they found out (they're little) and I told it's gunna be ok but to remind me to eat whole wheat tortillas instead of flour lol
Fickle_Associate4816,2022-04-27,4,Congrats on taking control of your situation! Any advice? Was weight loss the major contributor? Any diet tips?
cr67435,2022-04-27,9,"Thank you. Just eat light and cut carbs helped me alot, especially saturated fats. I cut that out. I eat alot of greens now, eat avocados, especially in the morning on whole wheat English muffins with a sunny side up egg with a glass of whole milk or just some honey nut cherrios in the morning for breakfast and I love the air fryer for my chicken dishes. Alot of it was depression and paranoia that got to me at the beginning but I also learned it was ok to feel paranoid but to use it in a positive way and that helped me not crave at night and to eat lightly but also I have young children, my wife and my dog I want to live for and I don't want to become dependant on insulin (nothing wrong or against anyone who is on it). I'm also a very stubborn person so it was hard at the beginning but it's also helping me say no to bad food. The art of balance my friend is key"
Igbok88,2022-04-27,3,"You're not cutting saturated fats out if you're eating eggs and a glass of whole milk. 

I too have cut most saturated fats when I was diagnosed. I have lost 60 lbs In a bit over 6 months.
 
I cut my sat fats to 4 grams per meal and 12 per day. That cut milk and any dairy out of my diet because the milk would replace a whole meal and I cant sacrifice that. I have found some fat free milk and cheese that works for me when needed."
Bunny-Love1996,2022-04-27,1,How many calories were you eating and what workouts were you doing?
Igbok88,2022-04-27,2,"I didn't even count calories. I looked at two numbers when it came to my diet. I looked at total carbs for diabetes and total saturated fats for my high cholesterol. 

Under 50 carbs per meal at 150 a day
Under 4 sat fat per meal at 12 a day.

I then followed that with walks of about 3 miles a day and I lost most of the weight that way. With those two numbers being low it would undoubtedly make my caloric intake low as well, I just didn't want to add another number to my diet to look after. 

I started at my diagnosis of 268 lbs now I'm at 210, just shy of 60lbs. 

My biggest struggle was the dairy as I drank milk everyday and had cheese on everything I ate. I loved mac and cheese, pizza, and all things cheese too much."

cr67435,2022-04-27,2,I got scared at first and lost like 10 lbs the first 2 weeks and since have dropped another 7. It took gradual time but a little over 4 weeks to drop from my highest of 465 to 91 this morning

fbyrne3,2022-04-27,3,"Unfortunately the disease is progressive. I did the same thing in my 40s. Got into shape, ate low carb, numbers came down with A1Cs between 5-6. But Father Time progresses and so does diabetes. In my late 50s it got harder and harder to maintain. 60s brought neuropathy even though my numbers have been good. My only advice to you is if your doctor tells you your numbers are fine for a diabetic get a new doctor.  The goal needs to be a maintained glucose level in normal ranges. Demand insulin for those occasions you eat carbs to excess. Dont compromise. The medical community sees you as an income for themselves. Nobody in this country should die of diabetes related causes. Even if you are disabled and cant exercise you should be prescribed insulin to keep you in normal ranges."
cr67435,2022-04-27,3,"Wow thank you for the advice. I will look into that and I do believe the medical industry is driven by pharmacies who thrive on continuing cycles of addiction to get paid.

sugarfreemt,2022-04-27,2,"If you have insurance you should check into one of their wellness programs.

friendless2,2022-04-29,7,"If your doctor said ""sugars"" they need to be replaced with a better doctor.  They should have said ""carbohydrates"", and recommended a reduction in bread, potatoes, rice, fruit, corn, oatmeal, cereal, desserts...

Most pre-diabetics are Type 2, which is insulin resistance, and it is genetic.  The body refuses to process insulin, and this causes elevation of glucose levels.

Some can reduce glucose levels with diet adjustment, others have to do that and add exercise, some can control it with exercise alone, others have to do both and add in medication.

Genetics causes this to happen."

If OP had a fasting BG of 114 that isn't outside the realm of possibility to be around their a1c.

MSV34,2022-04-29,1,"I never said that wasnt their a1c. Reread what Im responding to. The poster is suggesting the op could be t1. The likelihood theyre undiagnosed type 1 with an a1c of 5 WITHOUT the use of insulin, even in honeymoon, is so extremely unlikely its laughable. 

This subreddit loves to do this - always suggest t1 when it makes absolutely no sense. 5-8% of diabetics are type 1. From the original post, nothing suggests t1. Suggesting a doctor(s) missed something that Reddit users didnt is unlikely. Its not like c peptide and GAD testing is so insecure that only Reddit users know to check for it. 

My second point is what youre taking issue with and your analysis is off. An insulin dependent is not getting to an a1c of 5.0 without going low a lot.

5.0 is not even a pre diabetic a1c range."
vastmagick,2022-04-29,0,"&gt;The poster is suggesting the op could be t1.

They may or may not, I personally don't want to even get close to rule 6.  If you want to fight over how much of a chance, that is fine.  I just have no interest in gambling with OP's health.

&gt;An insulin dependent is not getting to an a1c of 5.0 without going low a lot.

You are assuming that insulin dependent means high blood sugar.  I agree if you have higher blood sugars that OP has said they would need to be going low to average to a 5.0 but that is not data given, so I'm not sure why you are falsely equivocating insulin dependent to any BG reading not given.  Becoming insulin dependent is not a binary you are, therefore you have high blood sugar or you aren't therefore you don't have high blood sugar.  In theory, there is a point where someone starts to develop insulin dependency and presumably your immune system (or however you want to say the dependency occurs) doesn't simultaneously remove all insulin production.  If you want to say that is unlikely OP is experiencing that, cool I don't care to gamble.  

The point still stands that given the information we do have from OP, a1c of 5.0 and fasting BG of 115 mg/dL is possible without frequent dangerous lows, regardless of insulin dependency."
MSV34,2022-04-30,0,"Not sure why youre being an argumentative asshole but the poster says theres a chance its T1. That is a suggestion. If thats hard for your brain to comprehend, Im very sorry for you. 

Im not assuming anything. It is a biological fact that human bodies require insulin. When they do not produce enough or any, which is the exact medical definition of type 1 diabetes, their body will display symptoms. Absolutely none of the symptoms or situations in the op suggest anything close to a person who has gone without insulin for a sustained period of time. 

And yes, because your body requires insulin, after eating, your blood sugar will rise if it goes without. An a1c that low will not happen if op had t1d."

MSV34,2022-04-30,0,"Op provides those metrics in the first line of the original post. Those same metrics are the first two blood tests used by medical standards to provide a diagnosis of diabetes. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2797383/

Ops numbers, which they provided, which youre missing because you cannot read, are in the prediabetic range. 


https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000305.htm

This article explains that diabetes is diagnosed after fasting blood glucose of 126 and an a1c over 6.5. Therefore, since his doctor, a medical professional, diagnosed him with pre diabetes, it stands to reason, op does not have t1d. 

https://www.jdrf.org/t1d-resources/about/diagnosis/

This article explains a c peptide test, the first diagnostic test to differentiate between t1d and t2d is only given when a patient presents with diabetes, which op, according to his medical profession and literature, does not have. Therefore, he does not even meet the threshold to have a c peptide test or antibody testing because, again, they do not meet the threshold for diabetes. 

So, again, because op does not have diabetes by any medical standard, it is quite impossible that at the time the op saw their doctor and had the blood work taken, they had t1d because a t1d diagnosis is predicated on the fact one needs to actually have diabetes."
vastmagick,2022-04-30,0,"&gt;Ops numbers, which they provided, which youre missing because you cannot read, are in the prediabetic range.

I have referenced them at you this whole conversation, so which of us is struggling to read?  I have already stated I am not interested in gambling with OP's health by guessing what their diagnosis is.  You are also flip flopping on your diagnosis because earlier you said:

&gt;5.0 is not even a pre diabetic a1c range.

This is why OP should not listen to internet strangers that want to gamble with their health.  You are more than happy to go back and forth on positions because you have no consequences to being wrong.

&gt;Therefore, since his doctor, a medical professional, diagnosed him with pre diabetes, it stands to reason, op does not have t1d.

I'm not sure why you want to gamble with OP's health so much, I'll repeat again, I have no interest in gambling with OP's health by breaking rule 6.

&gt;This article explains a c peptide test, the first diagnostic test to differentiate between t1d and t2d is only given when a patient presents with diabetes, which op, according to his medical profession and literature, does not have.

So you are **ASSUMING** that prediabetes is not diabetes?  Again I ask, why gamble with OP's health or argue against something I am not saying?

&gt;it is quite impossible that at the time the op saw their doctor and had the blood work taken, they had t1d because a t1d diagnosis is predicated on the fact one needs to actually have diabetes.

It isn't impossible, it just is unlikely in your nonmedical analysis of a patient you have never met.  This is just stupid logic too.  You can't be a t1d unless you are already a diabetic, that is so circular that it makes circles look square.  Doctor, go back to school before you continue treating patients on the internet that you never met."
MSV34,2022-04-30,0,"No, Im not assuming prediabetes is not diabetes. Im providing an article written by the ADA that explicitly states that and then Im typing it back to you. Its called learning. Thats when you understand something stated from an expert and retain that same information. 

Were literally not gambling with his health. Im reiterating to op and you of what his doctor, a medical professional, told him: you dont have diabetes, you have prediabetes lol. 

That determination, by his doctor, is what is leading his doctor NOT to check for c peptides and antibodies. Because literature from experts tells OTHER DOCTORS to check for those markers WHEN THEY HAVE diabetes, which op does not have.

wolfeofark,2022-04-29,-1,"I have no Idea what are those. I handed him the blood report, that's it. Though, from what I could read in it there was nothing out of normal range other than Fasting Blood sugar. I'll ask him about it. Thank you!"
sallygeorgia,2022-04-29,5,"Similar happened to me, it ended up being MODY. My first endo didn't diagnose it because it's relatively new and rare. Could be worth checking out."
flaz,2022-04-29,3,"This. Hardly any medical professionals know about MODY. A GCK-MODY will be normal weight, any age group (but being young and slim with what looks like type 2 is a give away for GCK-MODY), with fasting sugar between 100 and 145, a slightly higher than normal A1C, with post-prandial sugars that rarely spike above say 250. Low or no c-peptide at fasting, but c-peptides present with sugars in the 175-200-ish range (hard to convince doctors to test for that because they don't know what GCK-MODY is). No antibodies. GCK-MODYs require no treatment. It's rare. My wife and stepson have it.

That said, my dad has a fasting sugar of around 130 and an A1C about 5.0. He has no sugary foods at all. He's in denial about having T2 diabetes IMHO, but there's nothing I can do to convince him."
wolfeofark,2022-04-29,1,I'll mention this to the physician. I read about it a little but didn't understand much other than that it's rare and new. Thank you.
MSV34,2022-04-30,-2,"Op cannot have mody because they do not have diabetes. Mody is a type of diabetes, which based on his doctor and medical numbers provided, does not have. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2797383/

What you mean to say is that if op is ever diagnosed with diabetes, it could be mody."
flaz,2022-04-30,4,"No, MODY is genetic. You don't need a diagnosis to have it. It happens at conception. That's how genetics works. Just because your doctor doesn't say you have it, doesn't mean you don't have it. This nih article is primarily addressed at GCK-MODY diagnosis during pregnancy, but a good 3/4 of it is generally about GCK-MODY:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6628087/"
MSV34,2022-04-30,-4,"Im not sure why youre posting something about pregnant diabetics but isnt mody a form of diabetes?

My point is that op was not diagnosed with diabetes, so by medical standard, it cannot be t1d, t2d, t3d, mody, lada, gestational, or any other type because its a diagnosis he does not have. 

Thats like saying op has a Toyota Camry. In order to have a Toyota Camry, op needs a Toyota. The car mechanic told him its not a Toyota. Therefore, no Camry."
flaz,2022-04-30,2,"So by your standards, if you had a heart attack but didn't go to a doctor to say it was a heart attack, it never happened. Got it.

&gt; Im not sure why youre posting something about pregnant diabetics but isnt mody a form of diabetes?

SMH. You need to *read* what I said, and *read* the article."
MSV34,2022-04-30,-1,"No, using your example, Im saying op went to the doctor and they diagnosed him with angina, not a heart attack, based on their examination of the patient. 

Youre saying the doctor should check for nstemi. One cannot have had a nstemi without first being diagnosed with a heart attack."
flaz,2022-04-30,2,I still don't understand what you're getting at. Are you offended that OP is asking a question about their seemingly diabetic symptoms that seem weird to them without first getting a diagnosis?
MSV34,2022-04-30,1,"No, Im getting bothered that people are breaking rule 6. You, and others of course, are telling op to check for something he doesnt have, after seeing a medical profession. 

Op literally cannot have mody or any other types of diabetes UNTIL a medical professional diagnoses him with diabetes. 

His medical professional said that his symptoms do not meet the standard of diabetes, therefore, his doctor will not check for mody or t1 or t2 or anything else UNTIL it meets that threshold. 

Youre suggesting a type of heart attack when he just has angina. Thats literally what Im getting at.  You cannot have a specific type of heart attack without first having one lol. Pretty simple."
flaz,2022-04-30,2,"Nowhere in any of what I have said here have I suggested that the OP has GCK-MODY. What has been put forth is that with the particular symptoms that they have, this is what it *could* be. The OP even said they will bring it up with their physician.

I have personal experience with several medical professionals, including a pediatric endocrinologist, which is a specialty which should be well aware of what GCK-MODY is and they were not. That is the whole point of spreading awareness here. As the other MODY here pointed out to the OP, his symptoms fit that description. That doesn't mean that's what it is, that just means, bring it up with your doctor, and I added to that suggestion, specifically because of my experience with doctors' lack of awareness about it.

&gt; Op literally cannot have mody or any other types of diabetes UNTIL a medical professional diagnoses him with diabetes.

This statement of yours is factually incorrect."

wolfeofark,2022-04-29,1,Yeah a tiny bit more than eight. I don't know if that counts.
myohmymiketyson,2022-04-29,1,It won't do that in a non-diabetic.
KokoPuff12,2022-04-30,1,Makes sense that their bodies could balance the impact.
deflatermaus,2022-04-29,2,"Was your fasting test early in the morning?  It could be dawn  phenomenon.

Also, 115 is not that high.  Isn't 126 the threshold to be considered diabetic?"
myohmymiketyson,2022-04-29,1,"115 is prediabetic and dawn phenomenon isn't a problem for non-diabetics, otherwise they'd just throw out fasting glucose as a test."
wolfeofark,2022-04-29,0,"Yes, 8:00am. I'll look up the dawn phenomenon before mentioning it to the doctor. It said on the report that 100-125 was prediabetic. I'm just worried that if I'm going into prediabetic stage without eating sweets and sugars, what tf will happen if I do. Thank you for the comment!"

LordRiverknoll,2022-05-04,8,"
Medtronic 670's are fragile. They just don't survive my day to day. 

One went because of a recall, and that started a year long revolving door of poorly assembled pumps. 

Oftentimes the screen would get sneezed on and completely fail. In two instances the software just failed, and another three the buttons just stopped working."

2 potatoes are not going to have the same carb count for 20g of potatoes.  So this is a dream that really can't happen unless we are synthesizing all food to be identical.

The whole need to weigh random stuff like chips that come with a meal doesn't happen so you may get a few less or more chips than the menu states.

Then there is the sauce problem, where you don't want the BBQ sauce, you want Chipotle Ketchup instead.  Now your meal does not match the menu, and the amount of sauce is not precisely measured, and the randomness of grown ingredients still applies, so you are still guessing.

Then there is the math problem.  Various countries report carbohydrates as different values, some are per serving (which I assume your menu would use) where others are per 100g, and then they tell you how many grams the item weighs, and you have to figure it out.

Then there is the whole diabetes problem, where identical food on 2 days will produce widely various results."

PM_ME_YOUR_DND_SHEET,2022-05-06,1,"You may have a soft metal allergy. Not sure what the apple watches use, but I was concerned when getting my fitbit as I have a nickle allergy. My fitbit uses copper and I have gotten rashes from it. Some things that have helped me to avoid those very familiar rashes:

When it gets like this, let it breathe by switching to the other arm until it has completely healed. 

Placement is important, read in the app or manual. Mine sits about and inch above the wrist line.

If it gets wet make sure you dry it properly afterwards. Water and sweat getting trapped in that doesn't help it.

You are likely wearing it too tight. You want to wear it so that it can feel your pulse but you can still push it up with your other hand and it'll be either completely not touching the sensor to your arm or only slightly touching.

Keep it clean. If you have a vigorous workout or otherwise work up a sweat make sure that it gets cleaned off or wiped down around the same time you get hydrated. If it is particularly hot, try to wipe it down a couple of times a day.

I find that I need to adjust my strap on my watch a couple of times a day. If you are aware that you are wearing it, loosen it."

thejadsel,2022-05-06,1,"My first thought looking at it was irritation from it trapping sweat or other moisture, too. Which could possibly be indirectly related to diabetes, if your blood sugar has been up. I used to be so much more prone to sweat rashes when my levels were staying high. High glucose will encourage overgrowth of natural skin yeasts under warm damp conditions. Even if it's not connected to blood sugar levels, swapping bands or wrists so it'll stay drier under there should help, as other people have suggested.

Could also be an allergy to the new band material, but if that were my arm, especially with the weather warming up? I would guess moisture. Getting the band off there and some hydrocortisone cream should hopefully help it clear up, in either case"

I went to a hospital, severely dehydrated with other symptoms. As I was a ""farang"" (foreigner), they wanted to admit me, but the upfront cost was about 125,000 baht. I had 35,000 baht at the time. They gave me one saline IV and sent me home after taking about 25K baht off me.

If you think you are going to get ill there, make sure you have money to pay for the hospital.

Edit: It was NOT racism. The doctors and nurses were very nice and helpful. It was just the system.

It was a holiday weekend. I had work insurance, but no contacts I could ask, so I didn't know which hospital to go to for insurance coverage. I just had to suck it up and go to where the ambulance took me."

Weather makes the continent extremely hostile, so certain times of year evacuations aren't possible. You'd have to do some hard-core planning and have some solid luck for it to be a non-factor.

Nevertheless, Antarctica have medical barriers because sometimes the simplest tasks/things can be deadly. For example, for a lot of the continent you need to pass certain medical test or even have an appendicitis because resources are that scarce.

Personal opinion here, but just because someone has Dr. before their name doesn't make them helpful. I wouldn't trust my dentist with any major changes, and seeing a lot of stories on this sub, even endocrinologists can be the worst"

Fritzy76,2022-04-25,5,"I've been to Thailand many times and the health care is excellent if you have the funds.  You will find private and government hospitals, with private being more expensive and typically offering better care.  

In Bangkok if you want top notch care you can go to Bumrungrad International or Bangkok Hospital, both have specialized Diabetic/Endocrine departments.

In Surin it looks like you would probably be limited to the government hospital, so you may have a longer wait and an issue finding English speaking staff, but generally you'll be treated well.

For basic ailments like stomach issues you can get most medicines over the counter at any pharmacy.  

As for cost, outside of standard checkups I've used Bangkok Hospital twice.  Once for pink eye, which cost about 5000 baht for the initial visit, medications, and 2 follow ups, and once for a cut that needed stiches, which cost about 10000 baht including the initial visit, medications, and follow up."

random_guy_8735,2022-04-26,4,"There are the other basics, know what you insulins are called in that country NovoRapid vs NovoLog, including the technical name (Insulin Aspart) so if you do have to buy some over there you get what you need.  Your fine for Thailand as it is NovoRapid and Levemir (personal research)

Also in some countries that won't use the U100 that you are used to U40 or U60 isn't uncommon which means you will need to take more that usual.

You probably won't be able to get the same BG meter or test strips over there so if you run out be prepared to buy a new meter and random strips for the rest of your trip.

Pack extra supplies, you never know what will happen, Thai food for example can have a lot of hidden sugar.  Pack the supplies across as many carry on bags as you can to reduce the chances that they get lost.

Both Thailand and India are hot countries so a Frio wallet to protect your insulin while travelling is useful.

[https://diabetestravel.sansum.org/](https://diabetestravel.sansum.org/) can help you calculate how to adjust your long acting doses when you fly across timezones.

The only problem I have ever had traveling was at security when I was leaving Thailand where the officer wanted to know exactly how many spare needles I had in my carry on bag (answer however many were leftover from this trip).

Generally in Thailand the quality of the private hospitals is good, particularly in Bangkok, just make sure your insurance will cover you at that hospital before you go in.  And make sure you have insurance that covers your diabetes."

id trust cuban hospitals over US hospitals any day. 

I cant think of a single country were you wouldnt get care. Unless you go into deep rural areas of any country.

I can tell you very sad stories about my care in the US. If I was homeless in the US and living on the streets with diabetes I can fully assure you I would be dead."
QueenBitch68,2022-04-25,17,"OP stated outright that they heard these stories from others with underlying racism and wanted true information.

OP is looking to travel with a chronic illness and is asking SMART questions for the sake of their health. 

You mentioned India. Are you aware that many regions of India require family to provide food to hospitalized patients? There is no dietary service. There are still many countries that require most medications to be purchased and brought to the hospital for administration by hospital staff. If you are traveling alone, these would be major concerns.

Why do so many doctors come from India? BECAUSE MEDICAL SCHOOLS AND NURSING SCHOOLS IN INDIA USE TEXTBOOKS THAT TEACH WESTERN MEDICINE...it allows for an easier transition to USA. Same with nurses from the Philippines.


That is not privilege or racism you twit. Maybe YOU should check your ""righteous indignation"".


All that said, my suggestion to OP is...take the trips. Enjoy your life BUT get travel insurance with medical. I always makes sure I have medical with emergency medical evac. I take trips every year to some fairly ""poor"" countries... Think monthly salaries less than what I make in a day. There are beautiful places to explore and economies to support. Just have insurance and hope you never need it."
PicklesAreMyFriends,2022-04-25,6,Thanks for the answer without judgement lol
ClayWheelGirl,2022-04-25,-9,"The appropriate place for this question is a travel agency or the consulate.

There are rules in every country that apply to the local population  who lives there and rules that apply to visitors that are different. I cant imagine any major hospital in any major city not having food service in India especially watching the news coverage over Covid. Logic tells me what you describe is in other parts of the country perhaps the more rural part. So please dont add to the prejudice that is already out there"
QueenBitch68,2022-04-25,7,"I am not adding to prejudice. I am stating FACT. Just stop while you are behind.

Travel agents want to sell trips. Have they actually been to those countries and seen the healthcare first hand? A consular wants to portray their country in the best light. Also, their access to health care is very different from others.

In my opinion, the OP did well looking to an INTERNATIONAL online forum for info from people who have experienced it. OP was more likely to get real info rather than rose colored view from those with an agenda."
Accomplished-Job2627,2022-04-25,6,"Ok, so now I will throw in falling under the category that you don't know as much as you think you do.

I dont know how long I was undiagnosed, but I believe i must have been diabetic for quite a while since I felt normal when I went for that blood panel. After diagnoses and daily metformin the symptoms went away and what I had been living with became very obvious. Never seen over 400 again since then, but I did have 4 slices of pizza a couple months ago and might have visited the 400s again then. Now Im off metformin because we want another kid and a recent study showed increased chances of birth defects when taking metformin.

I'm active a bit and can be more but honestly growing up in the 90s this really didn't work well for my body and even worse today due to insulin resistance.

NovolinR is not a bad insulin, just a milder one.

The latest rapid insulin are too rapid for low carb diets. What can happen is you drop low initially then spike high when the protein is slowly digesting. 
R Insulin has a very close action time to protein, so it matches really well to a low carb, high protein diet.

Bigjoeyjoe81,2022-05-22,4,"Im sorry. That is such a hard situation.

Right now you could try eating as low carb as possible. Meats, eggs, healthy oils and green vegetables. Taking a dose of fast acting insulin with this may bring your sugar levels back to a manageable place. Then keep the food plan until you can afford more. If you have or can get a credit card, you may want to consider buying some with it. This situation is and can become even more serious rather quickly. Using a discount program might help. 

In the long run&Do you have insurance? Are you able to qualify for government sponsored health insurance due to low income? Could you buy some cheaper in another country? Those are all possible avenues to explore."

There's someone on Twitter (Dan Berman) who's done it, I'll go find their account and add it if you want to ask him. He's a libertarian that's advocated for the right to ship drugs from other countries to the U.S.

 It's currently illegal to have them shipped, but you can travel across the border and bring them across (Go figure). Anyways, he's pretty responsive to questions, so you should dm him. 

P.S.- Don't forget a cooler when you go!

Edit: I found one of Dan's posts, you can just click on his profile to dm him. https://twitter.com/DanForTexas/status/1362411757130678288?t=XVbvzxqe6iJncdxG2FKN8g&amp;s=19"
TechnoRat63,2022-05-22,0,"I know that this isn't a popular option for most redditors, but look into Walmart R and NPH.  No, it's not ""shytte"" insulin, it just operates at different rates than your Tresiba and Novolog.  R takes about twice as long as Novolog to start acting and NPH needs to be taken twice a day, rather than once for Tresiba.  Definitely check with your doctor for information on how to temporarily substitute N and R for Tresiba and Novolog."

hardcoredragonhunter,2022-05-23,1,Id definitely try to keto-diet as much as you can and then use the long acting insulin to dose for the small amounts of carbs that you can eat during the day so that youre at least getting some sugar.

Relbac7,2022-05-23,0,"Hello, I'm going to tell you something some people may disagree with but, I was taking long acting insulin every night and fast acting as needed, I was taking between 80 and 140 units a day. 4 weeks ago I started a modified keto diet (modified because sometimes you have to eat some carbs to keep your sugar from bottoming out) but since going keto I no longer take long acting insulin and I have been taking about 3 to 6 units of fast acting a week. I am now convinced if diabetic people eat mostly keto you need almost no insulin. It's kind of hard to eat like that sometimes but you just have to stick to it. Good luck to you."

I just always hated it when I had one. Snagging it sucks. Figuring out how to keep it all out of sight and tucked in sucks. But most of all, the feeling of being tethered to something 24/7 made me crazy. I uncapped it to use the bathroom one night and just forgot to reconnect it (I know that's on me but it was one time in nearly 10 years of having it.) I ended up in DKA the following morning because I had no insulin for like 8 hours while I slept. The omnipod doesn't have that issue but it is bulkier and I believe it's harder on the injection sites than the minimed. And i don't have to worry about forgetting to reconnect it because it's always on. That being said im on the fence. Obviously the best scenario would not having to wear one at all but we all know that's not an option"

Ninethlevel,2022-05-20,-5,My comments are solely to promote a healthy mental relationship to diabetes as it can destroy some's mental health. Situationally and in a physiological way as we are self regulating a huge part of our endocrine system
Run-And_Gun,2022-05-20,0,"Again, I will mostly agree with you here.  I say constantly, that dealing with this is mostly mental.  It's wrapping your head around it and ""making peace with it"".  Some people do get too wrapped up in the data.   I personally love all of the data available to me, but I don't let it freak me out.  It's kind of like looking at a weather app before I walk out of the house, so I know how to dress or looking at the radar to see if rain is coming so I know if I need to carry my raincoat to put on later."
Ninethlevel,2022-05-20,-26,"Don't take this as a personal comment as it is in reference to the many cgm posts on the sub. I view CGMs (I realize you might be referring to your pump) as learning tools and essentially training wheels. It is awesome to gain real time insight to bg trends but, I would think over time one should be accustomed to these trends and be ok testing manually. The goal is consistent control but, in the long run it shouldn't require constant oversight of bg. A healthy diabetic should be ok with a fasting bg, a post meal bg maybe mid day/pre dinner and a before bed. I've seen these CGMS make diabetics become super neurotic and also fear when they malfunction or happen to be without.

I make this comment here because as a father, active individual I cannot imagine having a cgm or pump attached to me constantly. 

Again much respect and I can understand your frustration when stuff like this happens. Just an overview based on the posts I typically see on here"
Run-And_Gun,2022-05-20,7,"First I will say that yes, you can survive this disease without modern things like pumps and CGM's.  But there is no way in hell I would voluntarily go back to MDI and only a glucose meter.

I spent over 22.5 years with only syringes and a meter.  I've been on a pump for \~13.5 years, CGM for 7 and have now been looping since the beginning of January.  Don't take this as a personal comment, but the comment is crap and more than likely based on (very) outdated knowledge or mindset.  CGM's are not what they were 8-10 years ago, where they were more along the lines of just ""learning tools"" to spot trends, etc.  They are now real-time information and feedback devices that can give many people the control and freedom that cannot be had with just test strips.  In the first few months of looping, it helped me drop my average BS by over 30 points and increase my TIR by over 30 percentage points.  Without a realtime system that can react to ever changing BS levels, that would be very hard, if not impossible, for a lot of people to do.

And I'm active, too.  I lift and I have a physical job with a ""schedule""(it's not in the slightest, but the best word to describe it) that would make most people go insane.  And my pump and CGM make it a (relative) piece of cake, as far as diabetes management is concerned."
taylorisacat,2022-05-20,13,"I respect your opinion but I disagree. I tested much more without a cgm, although this is my pump, because I was always so worried I wasnt feeling a high.

Now I dont really think about it unless my cgm goes off or I feel like my blood sugar is high or low.

But I think we should all not judge each other for personal choices. Life and diabetes are hard enough without being hard on each other."

Ninethlevel,2022-05-20,-10,"No judgement here. If it doesn't take from your life and adds to it, stick to it. I just worry about the younger diabetics who are probably introduced solely to cgms and freak out and over analyze. We are responsible for creating our own homeostasis when it comes to bg management and much more, that would mean hopefully at some point testing minimally and having a diet and lifestyle that is regimented enough to keep you within a range."
Run-And_Gun,2022-05-20,1,"I do agree on the point that those that have ONLY known the world with CGM's and pumps are much less likely to be able to function without them and don't know how to deal(well) with it when something happens to them, because they've never had to.  I don't want to not have mine, but I can handle it when something does happen.  I can deal with not having my CGM temporarily way better than if my pump went down(that's why I travel with my old pump as a back-up)."
Ninethlevel,2022-05-20,-1,"Yup agreed. I'm not saying you should go without them. You should do what optimizes your approach.
Overload of info to a person who doesn't have the knowledge to assess a plan of action can really make things a mess though. You are not the typical diabetic neither are almost all of the responses I got. Most typical diabetics you would've lost half way though your comments. So for the vast majority of diabetics I think the training wheels mentality is nothing outdated or negative. I totally see the other side of things to where it makes there life as close to normal as possible if they don't obsess and have a skewed perception of fluctuations in numbers. 

All of our comments are a product of us sharing what works for us. The last thing I want to do is make this disease anymore of my identity then it already is and just personal preference I hate even wearing clothes when I don't have to lol. It would definetly improve my bg and I'm not opposed to it in time but I am specifically referring to what the majority of posts regarding cgm content are on here and that is super neurotic and obsessive. Ofcourse it would be, it's like anything else nowadays we have unlimited access to things and we struggle to balance that privilege. 

I enjoy hearing these approaches. 

I'll give a easy to digest example of my point.

Say you take lantus which has such a dull peak and say you use humalog or its alternatives which is very fast acting. You don't necessarily have to eat the same foods meal by meal but if you understand macronutrient content (which you absolutely should as a diabetic) you can take the same amount of insulin per meal, the same amount of basal insulin per day and as we all understand yes you will have to be ready for curve balls. Throw in a regimented exercise routine and timing and you damn sure dont need a machine attached to you to optimize that. 

The problem is most people's issue is adherence to these variables and regimens i speak of and therefore they over complicate."
Most_Ambassador2951,2022-05-20,2,"Then let's also add in unstable female hormones, gastroparesis, and hypounaware and there's a recipe for disaster if you work a physically active job where you can't just up and leave to test and treat(yes I know the laws,  but there's also real world here)"
Ninethlevel,2022-05-20,1,I can relate I've had hell with gastroparesis (been in ICU.) From years of ignoring my numbers while working corporate jobs and early on having some horrible advice via endos that led to really stupid behavior. A cgm would have helped but the issue is I tested at least 10x a day but didn't manage things like stress and diet and just continued to exist in a negative feedback loop. That's my point about what you do with data is key. If that data serves you better opportunity to optimize I'm all for it but that should also include a healthy relationship mentally. What changed for me and it's not linear is when I value my health overall and make the right choices one at a time. If you have a standard you stick to and don't waiver you will see stability in your bg cgm or no cgm. Again most people's problem is adherence not access to info and data
Ninethlevel,2022-05-20,1,"Man can I relate. I've been working at a bank in a full suit, feel a hypo come on and within minutes I'm pouring sweat. What did I do? Go to the coffee table and disguise what I'm doing as ""can I get you coffee?"" Meanwhile I'm chugging 8 sugars with a swig of coffee. We agree, naturally we are individuals with our own ways of management and perspective."
Most_Ambassador2951,2022-05-22,1,"Yup, I'm an RN at a plasma center.  I work all areas and I'm in an unbreathable lab coat. Sometimes I'm in between the floor sticking people and the lab and -37°c freezer. There are times that I absolutely can not tell if I'm hypo or sweat pouring from running bottles and working my ass off. I would rather rely on a device than my coworkers using glucagon and 911 again"
ORGrown,2022-05-20,5,"Very, very few diabetics have stable enough routines that a CGM would not benefit them for. In all honestly, the pump would be less necessary than a CGM. The idea that having a ridiculous amount of real time information should be ""training wheels"" sounds like someone from 40 years ago adjusting their entire life's routine so that they can maintain stable numbers. The whole idea is that we have the technology now so that you don't have to do that. It provides freedom for people with diabetes to go do those things that they previously would've had to adjust their lives around. 

I'm an extremely active person (rock climbing, mountaineering, wilderness backpacking, etc.) and I would never, ever leave my CGM behind, and it's never been a problem during those activities. In fact, I feel much better doing them because I have real time updates of what my blood sugar levels are doing. I can prevent emergencies because of that information. 

I get what you're saying about people fearing a malfunction or not having these newer technologies, but these devices also make us markedly more healthy, and give us far more control over the disease. Average A1C levels for patients using a CGM versus not (taking into account controls and randomization within groups) showed a 1.0% decrease compared to non-cgm users. Since having an A1C of 8.0 results in 1.8 times greater risk of all-cause mortality compared to a 6.5^2, I think it's clear that being able to lower our A1Cs by a full percentage point is far more than just a training wheel. It literally leads to better health outcomes, and higher quality of life for people with diabetes.

Ninethlevel,2022-05-20,-2,Totally understand what you're saying. And I think based on your perspective they probably serve people with active lifestyles more as there are more unaccounted for variables that will impact sugar. I'm thinking more about the people who actually post so neurotically about sugars that really shouldn't freak you out that much as they can be corrected so easily (omg I'm 60 or omg I'm 200.) For people that maybe exercise 3-5 times a week in a casuall way and live pretty mundane lives (9-5'ers who typically eat meals at the same times through the day) they can most definetly optimize their bg where they may only have to test once to twice a day
ORGrown,2022-05-20,3,"I definitely understand where you're coming from about people being neurotic. That's understandable. Obsessing over your bg levels isn't healthy either. I agree with you 100% on that.

&gt; they can most definetly optimize their bg where they may only have to test once to twice a day

They certainly *can* optimize things. The idea with the newer tech is that they don't have to though, and you will still be healthier by using them, regardless of activity levels. CGMs and pumps make it so that you don't have to dedicate so much of your mental energy to thinking about and calculating all the time. You can more or less ignore the fact that you have a disease, instead of tailoring your life to that disease. I don't want to have to make sure I eat the exact same amount of carbs/fat/protein at the exact same time every day. I want to be able to join my coworkers for a celebratory piece of cake, or donuts during the meeting if I want to. Sometimes I decide I want to have pasta for lunch, sometimes it's a salad. All of those things that you don't think about as a person without diabetes suddenly become things you don't have to think about even with diabetes. And even without giving those things any thought at all, I'm still healthier than I would be without the tech. It's less about being reliant on the tech and more about being liberated from something that would otherwise influence every single aspect of your life. 

It's tough to explain to someone without diabetes just how much of your mental energy goes into managing the disease. What did you eat? What was the nutrient ratio in that food like? How active are you today? Are you stressed out? How stressed out are you? Is the exercise high intensity short duration, or low intensity long duration? What is the temperature like outside? Are you maybe developing a cold? Are your allergies acting up? Are you on your period? are you going through puberty/growing still? Maybe you're getting older and your body is slowing down instead? What am I going to be doing later? Am I going to have anything to drink? Am I dehydrated? Literally anytime you go somewhere: Do I have snacks with me? What type of snacks should I bring? Am I going to have to argue with security about bringing my snacks? Do the friends I'm going with know how to use a glucagon? Are they comfortable with that? Do they know not to give me insulin if I pass out? And to top it all off, if any of this goes wrong you can wake up in a hospital. Maybe. 

You talk about wanting to protect people's mental health, but I don't think you understand how much our mental health is affected by diabetes itself. Being able to reduce the amount of constant negotiations and mindfulness of the how/what/where/when involved with managing the disease is so much more than just the physical benefits of using the tech. It literally takes a massive number of those questions and lets you simply ignore them, you know, like people without diabetes do."
sluggyslime,2022-05-20,2,"Without my CGM, I would be dead. Im not exaggerating. It has sensed dangerous lows in the middle of the night that I would not have woken up for and ultimately bottomed out. My pump also keeps track of active insulin, which is another bonus because then I can tell if Im going to go low if Ive given myself too much insulin or if its been all too effective that day due to being more active. 

Its great that you dont feel you need one, but the longer you live with diabetes-the harder it gets to tell if youre going low."
Stargazer_0101,2022-05-20,-4,Hanging on the floor? Really? How does that happen?
taylorisacat,2022-05-20,4,"I had my pump site on my leg. The site came out and I have long tubing so it fell to the floor, thats how I noticed it was out."
Stargazer_0101,2022-05-20,-3,Just a misstatement. It is okay.
AvalieV,2022-05-20,-1,"I never understand how people do this. Cut holes in your pockets, run tubing inside clothes, problem solved. In 15 years pumping I think I've only ever ripped one out on a door handle once, maybe twice."
taylorisacat,2022-05-20,3,"I didnt catch it on a door handle. The adhesive didnt stick and it fell off after about 10 minutes. I also use IV prep beforehand.

I always have my tubing tucked in, rarely have the door handle issue."
AvalieV,2022-05-20,1,"Ahh I see. I have some skin sensitivity issues (reactions) with some of the adhesive, but my quicksets only fall off if I sweat / go swimming a lot. I use the 90 degree 6mm ones."

Kristal3615,2022-05-18,2,"1. 

Also, funny story! I got to learn I have claustrophobia through something like this. We had these prayer circle things at a church my husband and I used to go to where there would be one person in the middle and a bunch of people surrounding that person and put hands on them praying... The peacher grabbed my face to pray and I honestly don't know what anyone was saying because I was in full fight or flight mode trying to look for an escape (Which I'm sure me freaking out encouraged them to pray harder) and I was trying to convince myself not to headbutt or punch the preacher to let me go he asked me something... I honestly don't remember what, but when he asked again I said yes to whatever it was so I could go sit down. I sat down next to my husband in a full blown panic attack... I found out my husband casually mentioned to another preacher that lived by me that I have diabetes and he had no idea any of that was going to happen. So that's the story of how I almost hurt a preacher!"

I don't see the lappa getting confused with each other."
nrgins,2022-05-13,1,"/u/nevermindk9 just replied that they need to open the app first and tap the scan bar before scanning. I wonder why it's different for you? 

Also, do you have other NFC apps, such as Google Pay, installed?

P.S. what's a ""lappa""?"
reesecheese,2022-05-13,2,"I'm betting it's ""app/s"" but typo intruders!"
4MuddyPaws,2022-05-13,1,"It's apps.

All I do is hold my phone to the sensor and the app opens to show the results. I do not open the app first. And yes I have Google Play on my phone as well."
MizchiefKilz,2022-05-13,2,"I have a Samsung S21 and I have to unlock the phone first, but then can scan anytime and the libre app pops open and shows the number. Can then switch back to whatever app I was using. I've never had an issue with it trying to take a reading unintentionally it has to be pretty close to the sensor."
nrgins,2022-05-13,1,"That seems to contradict what others are saying, that you have to open the app first. Do you have a 3rd party reader attached to the sensor?"
Whyevenlive88,2022-05-13,2,"You don't have to open the app first, at least not on Android.  I've used a libre with multiple phones and none have to have the app open first."
nrgins,2022-05-13,1,Interesting. I wonder if u/jonathanlink is using an iphone?
jonathanlink,2022-05-13,1,I am. Sorry. Should have said that.
nrgins,2022-05-13,1,"No, not your fault. I didn't specify my phone type either. Didn't think it made a difference. I guess it does. Thanks"
nrgins,2022-05-13,1,And have you had other NFC apps on the phone at the same time? And it knew which app to use?
MizchiefKilz,2022-05-13,2,"I have google pay installed but typically use it via my watch vs. phone. I suppose there is some kind of ""NFC type"" detection to know which app to open?"
Whyevenlive88,2022-05-13,2,Yes.
reesecheese,2022-05-13,1,"I have an NFC app on my phone (for a different thing) and I have to open the app to use it. I found out that holding a hotel ""key"" card next to my phone will cause my phone to attempt to read it but no app opens. Samsung phone."
nrgins,2022-05-13,1,Interesting. We seem to be getting different answers here re. this.
reesecheese,2022-05-15,1,Also my phone is 400 years old or at least it is that age in phone years.
nrgins,2022-05-15,1,"Yeah, my old phone was giving me various problems with different apps. Developed over time. Happens.

So, I tried it with my new phone, and it works great! I just hold the phone next to the sensor and reading comes right up. Don't have to open the app first.

I do have to hold the back of the phone to it, and right over where the NFC antenna is (near the top of the phone).

Also, if there's a full screen something on the phone it doesn't work.

But, for the most part it works fine.

I did have a second app that was also trying to intercept the NFC signal. But I didn't need it anymore, so I installed it. Then everything was copacetic.

So, my advice: get a new phone. LOL

I'm with Boost Mobile ($35 a month for unlimited everything), and I got a new Galaxy A13 5G with 64 GB of RAM for $79. So I'm sure there's an inexpensive phone out there with your carrier that will make your life easier."
reesecheese,2022-05-15,1,"I live in a place where 15 minutes from the city there is nothing. Even though I travel almost never I worry about not having signal, so I use Verizon (and hate them). Also I'm old so change is hard =. I'm off to Google land to look into Boost, thanks!"
nrgins,2022-05-15,1,Boost Mobile uses the T-Mobile network for connecting. So it's good coverage.
reesecheese,2022-05-15,1,"Boost.com says ""there are no locations in your area"" ="
Wonder_Frau,2022-05-13,2,I think it varies based on the phone.
nevermindk9,2022-05-13,1,on my phone i need to open the app to tap the scan bar before getting a number.
nrgins,2022-05-13,1,That sux. =A Seems that using the reader is better in that regard. I just press a button and scan. I don't have to look at anything.
nevermindk9,2022-05-13,1,except that i also use the blucon transmitter. real-time cgm via phone. i scan the libre2 several times a day anyway just to capture redundant data for reporting the tracings to my endo.
nrgins,2022-05-13,1,"Ah, that's why. You're using a third party product. That explains it."
4MuddyPaws,2022-05-13,1,"Sorry. Lappa wad supposed to be apps. Phone. I do have Google Play installed. 

My Libre app does not have a scan bar. I just HD the phone to the sensor and get results. The phone does have to be on and ""awake"" though."
nevermindk9,2022-05-13,1,jfyi: the reader's a 'not-bad' bg/ketone meter if you can swing the costs of strips. mine's currently on drawer-duty.
nrgins,2022-05-13,1,You mean the libre reader? That's what I've been using.
nevermindk9,2022-05-13,1,yup
Imaginary-Bottle-684,2022-05-13,1,"My husband's phone will auto open the app and take his scan. Mine will not do that--I have to open the app to scan. I also have other NFC and Bluetooth medical devices paired to my phone, including a Kardia ekg, a blood pressure cuff, a fitbit, and my breast pumps (for when the time comes later this year). 

Also, don't forget that if you're using Libre 2, whichever device you scan to first is the one  you have to use the duration of the sensor. Lots of ppl on the FB users page seem to forget that and scan the reader first and get mad they can't scan with their phone."
nrgins,2022-05-13,1,I thought I read somewhere that if you scan with a second device within 15 minutes of activating the first device that it allows you to use two devices. Is that not the case?
Imaginary-Bottle-684,2022-05-14,1,"not with the Libre 2. With the Libre 14 day you can scan the reader first, and then the phone and it'll work.  However, if you scan Libre 14 day with your phone first, it WILL NOT scan with reader.  

Learned all of this the hard way. I used 14 day for 1.5 years and Libre 2 for 1.5 years."
nrgins,2022-05-14,2,"Actually, never mind. I just tried it myself. I posted this to get information before applying a new sensor in a week. But I realize that it probably wouldn't hurt anything to try it with the sensor that I have now, which is halfway done.

So I just installed the software and tried scanning the week old sensor and it worked fine! Yay!

It shows the same reading as the reader and shows that the sensor will expire in 7 days. And I was able to continue using the reader afterwards.

So that's good to know that I can use it with either one as long as I scan with the reader first. This way, in the middle of the night, if I can't find my phone, I can just grab the reader. Or if I can't find my phone I can use the reader.

And then when the Libre 3 comes out in a few months none of this will matter because it'll send the readings to the phone every minute through Bluetooth.

So I think I'm good to go! Thanks for the reply."
nrgins,2022-05-14,1,"Interesting. Someone else (u/BigGuy01590) who seems to be using the Libre 2, says that it does work with his sensor.

Also, do you know if there's a time limit regarding how long you have after first scanning with the reader to scan with the phone before it doesn't allow you to do that?

Thanks"
BigGuy01590,2022-05-14,1,"No time limit that I know of.   To be clear if you activate with the phone, you can only use that phone.

I am using the 14 day libre, because it took Abbott a living time to get the Android phone app released."
ukkohertell,2022-05-13,1,"I use Libre 2 with my android phone. The scanning is terrible. Sometimes the phone just vibrates without even giving a message on screen (with the app open and something happens as the screen briefly flashes, might be the error message that just for some reason disappears instantly). Sometimes it opens an ""invisible"" app window on the phone screen if I try to scan without the app open. 

Sometimes closing other apps or clearing notifications helps. Sometimes clearing the app's cache helps. Sometimes only rebooting the whole phone helps. But the worst thing is that sometimes it works completely fine and I haven't been able to pin point the problem into anything specific... This is honestly so frustrating.

Oh, and I have called Abbot's support. They didn't give me a solution at all. They just brushed it under the rug, because my phone is not in their list of supported phones (that has like ten phones from 2015).

Otherwise, the NFC functions correctly on my phone!"
nrgins,2022-05-14,1,"How old is your phone? I noticed with things like this, that phones start to become problematic over time. I think it probably has to do either with components coming loose or getting corroded, or perhaps software issues. Either way, it seems that weird problems like that seem to happen with older phones. 

What kind of phone is it?"
nrgins,2022-05-22,1,"I started using my phone to scan since I posted this. I found the same things -- that sometimes you get the vibration or whatever.

I realized, though, that with battery saver enabled for the app (which it is by default), the app will be somewhat asleep when you first use it. So I wonder if that's an issue.

In any case, I turned battery saver off for the app, and so far it seems to be working well. Definitely something to try."
ukkohertell,2022-05-22,1,I called Abbot's support again. They told me that the problem is my OnePlus phone and it's operating system not being compatible...
nrgins,2022-05-22,1,"Well, what else are they going to say? They're not technical experts there. They can just give generic advice on how to handle problems.

I think you'd be better off posting in a technical form and seeing what kind of advice you get--one that deals specifically with NFC issues, or one related to your phone or Android in general.

And if you haven't tried turning off power saving yet, I would definitely try that and see if it makes a difference."
jonathanlink,2022-05-13,0,You have to have the app open to scan a Libre. But you can shortcut hold the app button and pick scan and skip some taps.
nrgins,2022-05-13,1,Good to know. Thanks!

BeFlatLine,2022-05-12,2,"Being an adult with more ""level"" hormones helps. Closed loop systems and consistency (ie: eating foods you know how much to bolus for and when, waking up / activity / sleeping at the same times) really helps a lot too.

AaronDer1357,2022-05-13,2,I am typically between 6.5 - 7.0 and my Endo is perfectly happy because I'm rarely keeping blood glucose below 80

Keith__Peterson,2022-05-12,8,"My best advice is try and get on Fiasp for your bolus insulin. I bolus before or after I eat and if I need more insulin my good ol libre alarms will let me know and I correct based off the trends. No stressing about going low or high. 

Make sure your basal dose is correct. Know your trends on the libre and set your alarms so you can catch lows or highs before they happen."
brina2014,2022-05-12,10,Are you having frequent hypoglycemia? I'm really happy for you that's an amazing a1c. I would just be worried about one this low meaning I was having too many low blood sugars

BeFlatLine,2022-05-12,2,"Are you on a pump or doing multiple daily injections? I found Fiasp to be great at lower doses in my pump, but if I needed more insulin than normal it would irritate my infusion site which would cause absorption issues. I've since switched to mixing Novolog with Fiasp (F60N roughly) . My most recent A1C was 5.8% - so, not as good as yours but I'll take it.


I've heard amazing things about Lyumjev, but unfortunately my insurance won't cover it. Hoping next year they will."

t40,2022-05-13,3,It's been shown many times that there's very little difference between MDI and pump therapy in open loop control; the most important factor in getting good results is having a CGM.

I'm a middle class income person living in a working class neighborhood--ive found that grocery availability is heavily dependent on the socioeconomic makeup of the surrounding area. 

Like my neighborhood--the deli meat is garbage, but you can't beat the ginger, avocados, garlic, chicken, niche sodas and sundry asian stuff (lot of south American, south east Asian, African and black people in my neighborhood, I'm white as hell if that's not painfully obvious). 

Over on the rich side of town where we go specifically for deli stuff, sodas are mostly just standard, deli stuff is good, some produce is better but tends to be underripe, more keto stuff and the variety of available cereal is downright mind blowing."

kashy87,2022-04-27,8,Sucralose isn't even really bad for you. Your body doesn't process it at all.  It just passes through quickly which is what causes the fun side effect of worshiping the porcelain. Worst case scenario is dehydration.
mardrae,2022-04-28,0,I had way worse than that. Sucrolose nade me seriously depressed- almost suicidal
Redwood671,2022-04-27,2,I tried this when they first released it for Spider Man Far From Home and was not a fan. It just didn't taste right to me. I'm curious of others opinions on it because I didn't see anyone else around that time talk about it.
Miggz612,2022-04-27,2,I love the cream soda one. Hoping they have this at my store!
BubbaChanel,2022-04-27,2,"I dont drink that one, but Amazon carries it."

jg135111,2022-04-27,5,Its a new dark berry flavor
j3qnmp,2022-04-27,3,Oh shit. Didn't even see that part. You'd think it'd be highlighted or detailed in a way like the cherry one

silentGlikelasagna05,2022-04-27,1,Im assuming dark berry is similar to a blackberry/raspberry flavor..?
Nikkisixx0725,2022-04-27,1,Do the cream sodas taste like cream soda ? Or is it just like...dr pepper flavored cream soda ?

buzzybody21,2022-05-17,16,Over 800. I didnt know I had diabetes.
BigOdie,2022-05-17,3,"Wow... thank you for the perspective. And I had no idea. The guy doing my fingerprick was just casually asking if I was used to finger pricks and I was just thinking ""why the hell would I be?!"""

Adamthebalding,2022-05-17,8,348 is bad but its not like hospital bad. Dont worry you caught it in time!
BigOdie,2022-05-17,3,Thank you for the support. I'm honestly glad I caught it at a stage I can manage it. It's just a lot learning you have a chronic disease. Hearing from other people who've navigated that means so so much.
jinkies3678,2022-05-17,2,"What I am noticing is that as I adjust to my sugar levels dropping, I have moment where I feel like something is wrong and need to take a minute to sit and relax. Also attributing some of this to adjusting to meds. I don't mention that to cause you alarm, but to say just don't be surprised if you encounter that. I recommend talking to your doctor a lot over the coming weeks. Write down your questions or notable events for your next visit, etc.  This community has also been an awesome resource!"
FunnyHighway9575,2022-05-17,8,400+ I think my a1c was 13 or so when I was diagnosed.
BigOdie,2022-05-17,3,I'm still waiting on my a1c. Did you feel weird when you were existing with more than triple (or 4x for you) the average healthy range?
FunnyHighway9575,2022-05-17,5,Honestly I felt fine but I was thirsty/drinking water almost all day to the point to where I was sick from drinking so much water but I was still thirsty. Finally went to the doctor and that's when I got the bad news.
BigOdie,2022-05-17,2,I feel you there. I have ADHD and my meds dry me out so I thought it was just related that.
Zealousideal-Slide98,2022-05-17,3,"I felt weird. And I had a lot of symptoms that I didnt realize were even symptoms until I started feeling better after getting my blood sugar down. I had blurred vision, I just felt sick all the time, I was very tired. I chalked it up to stress until I got diagnosed."
jinkies3678,2022-05-17,2,"All of these comments are so relatable. I went in because I just wasn't feeling right. I have a history of some strange panic attacks and thought what I was experiencing was something related to that. We cleared cardio and did bloodwork a year ago and there was no indication of diabetes, so it was a surprise when it showed up this time. +1 to drinking all the water in the world."
BigOdie,2022-05-17,6,"Also, thank you all for your input. I don't really know other diabetes peoples. So your words mean a lot. I'm really glad I got diagnosed because now I know what the problem is and I can move forward."

BigOdie,2022-05-17,1,Just be glad they caught it. From everything I've been reading us type 2 can impact a lot with a healthy diet and exercise.
laprimera,2022-05-17,5,"The first time I ever checked my own blood sugar it was 343, but I was diagnosed with a 288 fasting reading a few days earlier. I'm type 1, diagnosed as an adult."
nrgins,2022-05-17,3,"That's pretty typical. Mine was 400 when I (T2) was diagnosed. My son (T1) was 800 when he was diagnosed. Having blood sugar around 250 sometimes happens if you're not careful. So 348, while not good, is definitely not something to freak out about."
BigOdie,2022-05-17,1,My dad literally just talked to a nurse about a month ago about his diabetes but it never occurred to me that I was at risk.
nrgins,2022-05-17,2,"Well, now you know. The main thing is that you caught it, and now you'll be able to keep it under control."
RussellZoloft,2022-05-17,3,"T2, 600. Had no clue."
BigOdie,2022-05-17,2,"The surprise is what got me. Going from ""I'm not feeling great"" to ""the reason you feel dehydrated is your body is fighting all that sugar"" was just jarring. I'm happy I caught it."

younghannahg,2022-05-18,2,I felt fine! Just couldn't hold my bladder.
BigOdie,2022-05-18,2,Same. Maximum urgency every like 90 min or so.
ClayWheelGirl,2022-05-17,3,"but sometimes numbers are not the same for everyone.

at 160 my body shuts down. ie extreme fatigue, blurry vision, woolly brain, just feeling yucky. I fall asleep in the middle of a conversation. If I am in the middle of a task, I get very cranky I want to finish the task quickly because Im just done.

when my sugar was going wacko under prednisone the doctors defined MY numbers. if my sugars crossed 240 n i was unable to control it i was asked to go to the ER."
BigOdie,2022-05-17,1,Thank you for this perspective. Honestly I didn't realize that it seems obvious that levels could be 'relative'.
ClayWheelGirl,2022-05-17,2,"neither did i till it happened to me. made me feel like an imposter posting here. 

when i spoke to the advice nurse she told me first they go by symptoms and then numbers - unless the patient is comatose or not showing any symptoms. she asked me a LOT of questions.

mind you half my family n extended family i grew up with has diabetes. i watched their behaviors. watched my mom being loose and strict depending on her test result, but not unreasonable n live thru her 90s with no other major health issues except some anxiety sometimes after my father passed away. yet watched those who werent careful at all barely make their 60s."

baffojoy,2022-05-17,2,"Hey, man, mine was 342 I think, (or 9.9 A1c) when I got diagnosed, within a month of diet changes (going low carb) it was 130. Endocrinologist hasn't scheduled another A1C yet, but I get the routine finger prick every month when I've had to refill my medication and so far its been fine."
BigOdie,2022-05-17,1,"I just got my A1c back and it was 9.0 , I'm meeting with my primary in a week. The metformin already has me feeling better and I've been real strict about changing my diet. Hopefully I'll be where you are at."
baffojoy,2022-05-17,2,"Just keep in mind carbohydrates are a form of energy, we just can't have as much as we used to. I mainly have to carb count and just set a limit of 150g of carbs (this might not be low carb for some, but it is for me) max in total for the day. I'm not at the stage where I have to do finger pricks outside my consultations, management plans in Japan is massive ESID (every situation is different). So far my fiance's family and my friends who are registered nurses are the ones who filled in the gaps for me when it came to diet and how to manage it since my endocrinologist doesn't speak English fluently, and I don't have enough medical knowledge in Japanese.Try not to stress too much, it's good to be mindful but you have this in the bag and you're doing what you can.

Glad the metformin was working for you, I went through a runny adjustment period before things leveled out haha. P.S I'm 31 when I got diagnosed and further found out T2 runs on my dad's side and he's known for over a decade (but started taking medication after the dietary changes didn't help) and he's been managing it fine and almost in his 70's."

Tabbychiro,2022-05-17,2,"I was first diagnosed many years ago, back in the 20th century. I think my a1c was in the 11ish range. Got the T2 under control eventually with meds then insulin and then just tried to control with diet and exercise. Then for years (probably at least a decade), I lived in denial and stopped thinking about diabetes. Well its all catching up to me now. My vision has really been affected. Im getting treated for diabetic retinopathy now. And I need cataract surgery. My last a1c was in March and it was 15.2. I was surprised I didnt feel worse.

Edit: looks like mormst of these are related to ignorance of type 1 vs. Type 2. We really need a different name for this disease."
standingdonkey0615,2022-05-10,3,"I disagree. I think its ignorance towards diabetes as a whole. Type 2 isnt just a matter of eating too much sugar either. As type 1 diabetics we hate when people make assumptions like that about us, but then we push that stigma back into type 2s. No one deserves comments like that regardless of their type."
East-Tumbleweed,2022-05-10,-3,"Well, for a dude who's just been told he has an autoimmune disease and can't do anything to fix it, it kind of sucks to be thrown in with the type 2's who can do something about it (even go into remission). That and the assumption of people like my coworker I mentioned is that I did this to myself by stuffing my face with junk food. As someone who's highly conscious of what I eat, that really sucks."
Not_Stupid,2022-05-10,3,"I mean, you *can* do something to fix it - manually replace the function of your pancreas with injected insulin.  It's an absolute pain in the arse, and difficult to maintain over the long term.  But then, so is managing type-2.

I was initially diagnosed as type-1, and came to terms with having to inject insulin to account for my lifestyle and diet.  Then it turned out I had type 2 and had to change my lifestyle and diet entirely.

Both are challenging."
FuzzyDunlop007,2022-05-10,2,"Not all type 2s can go into remission. Im sorry your coworkers believe you caused it, we as a whole get that a lot, but T2Ds didnt cause theirs, either. The diseases have the same name bc of the organ it affects. And some T2Ds have to get on insulin as well. This is adding to the stigma around T2 diabetes and that isnt fair to them."
East-Tumbleweed,2022-05-10,0,"Hang on are you saying there are other causes of insulin resistance outside of excessive carb intake? If so, then I am ignorant as well and I apologise."
WCPass,2022-05-10,1,"I've been pretty lucky honestly.  I get the old ""But you're so thin"" every once in a while, but that doesn't really bother me. Everyone at work has been super cool though and honestly almost over concerned at times, and my family has a few nurses, and a lot of autoimmune diseases so they've been pretty cool about it as well. Most people that have said silly, or uneducated things just had no exposure and were hinestly eager to hear my explanation of why I could eat that cupcake, or why I kept Starburst on my desk. Probably helps that I was in my 30s before diagnosis so I didn't have to deal with a lot of young kids/high schoolers"
Petra_Ann,2022-05-10,1,"The ""sure you can eat that?"" right now I'm in Iceland, was out with friends on Sunday and landed at a bakery that specializes in Nordic style cinnamon rolls. I had my bun on my plate, bolus, and one guy is all ""forgot you're diabetic,sure you should eat that?"" I locked eyes with him and described what was going to happen if he tried to take it away... Besides, it's cinnamon. Totally doesn't count. >#(and omg it was amazing.. Good thing I don't live here)"
AeroNoob333,2022-04-25,4,"Everyone on my moms side has T2 (mom, uncles, aunts, cousins had gestational, etc.)

Im not 100% sure about my dads side and who has them. My dad has diabetes and he had a brother that passed away suddenly even though he was healthy. Could have been DKA.

My brothers do not have T2 at the moment, but I seem to have inherited whatever it is that my dads side has, which is more insulin deficiency than insulin resistance. Its possible that my brothers and I will also develop insulin resistance (T2), but it probably wont manifest until later in life like it did for my mom, aunts, and uncles. Lol I could have the double whammy of diabetes. So much fun."
HeatVision13,2022-04-25,2,The insulin deficiency sounds more like MODY. I hope you at least don't inherit both because MODY seems somewhat more manageable than T2
AeroNoob333,2022-04-25,2,"Yeah so I did a MODY genetic panel and they found a Variation of Unknown Significance so Im just on insulin now since that seems to give me the best control. We tried sulfonylureas and that sucked lol. Metformin didnt do anything for me. We never tried GLP-1 receptor agonists like Ozempic though because I lift weights and eat a lot to build muscle and I would probably be miserable with an appetite suppressant.

Only time will tell if I inherited both. Ill probably watch out for it in my 50s and 60s to see if my injected insulin just all of a sudden becomes ineffective."
HeatVision13,2022-04-25,1,You seem healthy. And you have not mentioned any symptoms. It's probably one of the milder MODYs. Diet still normal or has that changed too?
AeroNoob333,2022-04-25,1,"My diet changes based on my training cycle. Generally, Im bulking for about 8 months in the year then cutting 3-4 months. But, that only differs in the amount of calories and the distribution of my macronutrients (slightly). I used to eat a lot more carbs before diagnosis but Ive started to eat more fat just because its easier to cover with insulin. My protein consumption remains the same, but its already pretty high anyway. The problem with it is the higher fat is raising my cholesterol levels, so I may have to go back to that high carb diet to lower the cholesterol and just cover the carbs with more insulin. I used to eat 45% carbs, 30% protein, 25% fat by percent calories and now its more even across the board. I also have a history of high cholesterol, but the diet for diabetes and cholesterol is completely opposite unless the reason for having them is partially related to weight, but Im at a really good weight and muscle conditioning so its a bit weird for me."
bookofp,2022-04-25,1,What is MODY?
HeatVision13,2022-04-25,1,"Mature onset diabetes on the young. It's insulin deficiency but more of a mutation than an autoimmune response. It doesn't destroy all of your beta cells, it just limits how much of it works to release insulin. Most people who have just exclusively MODY live normal lives with treatment."
SummerJinkx,2022-04-25,3,"My parents and my grandparents from both sides, also almost 90% of my relatives have fucking diabetes, there is no escape for me lol"

jehkjehk,2022-04-25,2,"Mom side: Geandma is now diabetic, and Mom was prediabetic but dodged it thru diet ane exercise and probably from paat trauma


Dad side: This side pf my family won the bad gene pool. Everyone got diabetes, my cousins passed away young like in their 30s due to complication of diabetes.
My dad was blind kn one eye and passed away with kidney failure, due to complications of diabetes. I was conceived when his diabetes was raging and my Mom had told me that I was going to get it eventually, and she was not wrong. 

Hence, the reason I havent told my Mom about my diabetes and being properly diagnosed at 30 years old. So I made sure my diabetes is all under controlled and working on telling her about my diagnosis, not like she doesn't know already, because Moms... they know. But to find out that your daughter has the same illness at what killed ypur husband, it will foresure be traumatic."

HeatVision13,2022-04-25,1,"As for myself, my grandpa had diabetes, but it was likely type 3c due to the pancreatic damage he inflicted from relentless drinking. Grandma was low prediabetic recently but it seems the notion that it shouldn't be a prediagnosis for ages 70 and up holds up, she became normoglycemic through all measurements.

So not sure how that impacted my diabetes development in my 30's."
HeatVision13,2022-04-25,1,You ever considered that maybe you have LADA? you have two autoimmune conditions.
Wonder_Frau,2022-04-25,1,"Well, my metformin and diet seem to be doing the trick for now, I might ask my doctor about this of things start to get out of hand"
HeatVision13,2022-04-25,1,"Yeah.. Age should be your biggest risk factor if you inherited type 2, considering your relatives developed it late in their lives. It's odd that you developed it so young and in cohesion with other conditions."
Acrobatic_Edge1996,2022-04-25,1,None. My family all has Type 1. It makes no sense
HeatVision13,2022-04-25,1,"Well, you are technically type 1. LADA follows the same physiological problems of T1. That's the thing though, supposedly, it's harder to establish hereditary inheritance with T1"
Acrobatic_Edge1996,2022-04-25,1,"Nope, I test negative for all the T1 tests. And while I am insulin dependent, Im also now on Trulicity and its helping"
HeatVision13,2022-04-25,1,Have you done MODY testing?
Acrobatic_Edge1996,2022-04-25,1,Honestly I wouldnt even know how to test for it
Acrobatic_Edge1996,2022-04-25,1,"Ah yep I looked it up. Technically Im in the obese range, though I do have an active lifestyle. So i probably am Type 2, just caught it earlier than most."
HeatVision13,2022-04-25,2,"Still, it's odd that you are insulin dependent at such an age and it's been proven that a good majority of people who are obese don't even have severe insulin resistance. Perhaps some of your relatives are insulin resistant now. That is quite boggling indeed."

I have type 2 risk factors (wasnt super active pre-diagnosis and obesity) but never had BS problems until after pancreatic surgery about a year ago.

It's kind of odd as my Mom's side seems to be more heath-conscious (not that any of them are athletes) where my dad's side is more of the Mt. Dew and Pizza every night crowd.

Both came from extreme poverty for generations, most lived on farms until my parent's generation, going back to the colonial US where they were share croppers, and others coming over later from Ireland.

I would say my generation was really the first one that had an abundance of food from early childhood and the idea that you could eat too much or eat too much of the wrong kind of food just wasn't' really a concept to them."

My Dad was supposedly diagnosed T2 BUT he takes no medication, eats whatever he wants and almost never tests. One night he ate 2 burgers, a huge serving of potato salad, Mac n cheese and a huge slice of birthday cake and his glucose after dinner was 6 so if he has diabetes at all its a mild prediabetes.

My maternal grandma was T1, diagnosed late in life and insulin dependent. 

They suspect I am LADA, my diabetes came on after a viral illness and I dropped 30lbs and was thirsty, starving and peeing like a racehorse. I am not significantly overweight, I carry about 15lbs more than I should. 

Im on metformin currently with basal insulin. I have 2 other autoimmune diseases. I dont know why they dont test for antibodies but they keep telling me its too expensive here in Canada and it wouldnt change my treatment anyway. 

There is definitely a hereditary pattern in my family for both types. I seem to take after my maternal side and my brother after my dad and grandpa. Brother is significantly overweight and had no symptoms upon diagnosis."

But if I work out first thing in the morning (no bolus all night, maybe I've eaten a small snack but took no insulin), then I can do a whole workout and keep from going low.

Stevo7991,2022-05-24,2,Are you pre-treating yourself before you exercise? have a snack or something before hand?
soupdawg,2022-05-24,2,"I am. But it really sucks, defeats the whole purpose."
DogKnowsBest,2022-05-24,11,"It doesn't defeat the whole purpose.  Exercise doesn't just benefit you with immediate results.  Exercise is a building block to get your body more efficient; lose weight (if that's a goal), burn calories (and carbs) more efficiently. It will improve your overall health.

Yes, you're dropping now, but by being effective in putting in some carbs at the right time, you'll still be ahead of the game and in weeks, months, or many months, you'll likely see really great results in your overall health."
Stevo7991,2022-05-24,7,"\^\^ this

eating is so important for exercise :) I'm not suggesting having a bar of chocolate before you work out, have a complex carbohydrate, something to bump you up and sustain you the whole time, I would always keep a Banana in my bag, have it before I go to gym and it would give me the energy I needed to smash it out and not go low :)

Everyone is different though, whatever works for you!

Going low would absolutely ruin my workout so it became very important to me to counteract it"
leftylucy12345,2022-05-24,2,"Totally agree with the banana  saw it in a thread last week and now when I go for my walk at night , I bring a Banana with me and eat it about halfway through and keeps me at my levels.  Just diagnosed t1d in March and was trying to figure that part out as well because I was going to low even with a 15 min walk."
Stevo7991,2022-05-25,1,"Easy to pack, easy to eat and good energy! perfect snack haha"
rtz13th,2022-05-24,2,"Maybe it feels like that, but your body needs it. If you get into the practice of regular exercise, after a while your body will get used to it and give you a lot less hypos (happened to me when I started from not much movement to running marathons within a few years)"
soupdawg,2022-05-24,3,"Eh. I dont know about that. Are you type 1? Ive been running for years and I feel like since being on the pump its been a lot more difficult to run without getting low, even with exercise mode turned on."
rtz13th,2022-05-24,1,"Type 1 but not on a pump. As my body got more into it, I noticed that I have a lot less quick dips to hypo territory.

When I've been slacking a bit, it came back but that's kimd of my experience. I've done like 3-4x runs weekly, around 5-10kms."
soupdawg,2022-05-24,1,That is interesting. Did you have to adjust your basal rate any?
rtz13th,2022-05-24,1,"Yeah, adjusting in advance in line with training plan. Also the weird thing after long runs is how much your body is still working after the run at night. Need some planning so you won't go down when you're body is so tired that your brain might not wake you up."
FlashcrySamurai,2022-05-24,2,"Same thing for me sometimes. It's gotten better as I've gotten into a habit of working out regularly, but it's still annoying :(

Working out in the morning seems to work better for me, otherwise I need to wait 5+ hours after taking meal time insulin.

Did you start around 6? How long were you exercising?"
soupdawg,2022-05-24,1,Started at 6 and ran for about 30 min
Agent_Love,2022-05-24,2,"Snack before you work out. If you are trying to lose weight or significantly increase muscle mass, remember you might need to decrease your long acting insulin as you make progress."
little__death,2022-05-24,2,"I usually suspend my pump for half an hour or drop my basal by 50% if I'm doing any kind of exercise more strenuous than a brisk walk. Doesn't work for everyone, though."
soupdawg,2022-05-24,1,Do you suspend for 30 min before starting?
little__death,2022-05-24,1,"It depends on what I'm doing. If it's something like a long hike or a shorter run I'll try to start a little high, maybe in the 140 range, and suspend my pump when I start. I also try to have little to no bolus on board. Then my numbers will drop, but not too far.

It is possible to get what's called euglycemic DKA when doing this, though, so I never suspend it for very long. I'm also super sensitive to insulin, that probably makes a difference. But it means I don't have to snack as much which is nice."
Portsil_PA,2022-05-24,2,I usually stop the pump... that's the only way.
MildlySuspiciousBlob,2022-05-24,2,"Are you bolusing right before exercising? If I go out for a low impact walk after taking my insulin, my carb ratio needs to be 1:12 to avoid a low instead of my usual 1:8"
NarrowForce9,2022-05-24,2,Was told by a diabetes educator that weights actually increase sugar production while aerobics depletes. So for me to work out in that order. Can anyone confirm this?
little__death,2022-05-24,2,A moderate to intense weightlifting session does cause a sugar spike for me. Apparently if you are lifting hard enough you get a cortisol spike which in turn causes your liver to release sugar (like dawn phenomenon).
NarrowForce9,2022-05-24,1,Thanks for that insight. Its counterintuitive to me but now I know more.

Lifting weights? Well now my gum session is longer by 15 minutes and Im nervous about going too intense in case I drop back down"
AeroNoob333,2022-05-24,2,"Are you on pump? This is why I havent gotten on a pump. It seems long acting insulin like Tresiba is less affected by exercise. You may have to suspend your pump before doing any cardio (not sure how long before, tho)"
sunny_thinks,2022-05-24,2,"So I suspend insulin one hour before going for a run, have a snack with no bolus, and then majorly reduce my insulin after. If youre not suspending/reducing your basal at least 30 mins before you go out, whatever is in your system is going hit fast and hard in about 15 mins. Learned this very painfully&. 
  
Oh and my IC ratios change after exercise too, so keep that in mind as well&"

rakawido,2022-05-11,10,"It is definitely not #2 even though plenty of snake oil salesmen will try to convince you it's #2. It's #1. My insulin resistance is caused by PCOS, an endocrine disorder. There is no cure for this disease. We can manage diabetes and we can manage PCOS, but we cannot cure them.

I'm ready to tear my hair out at the number of ""social media influencers"" (skinny, privileged, wealthy, attractive, white women) trying to convince us that if we **just** ate enough raw, organic, vegan, locally sourced, ethically produced, community grown turnip roots, we'd all be cured. It's fucking nonsense."
Leera_xD,2022-05-12,1,"this this this a million times. I have the same issues as you. I was diagnosed with PCOS in my early 20s. I also have a plethora of GI problems which caused me to get my gallbladder removed and change my diet. Then one day in my late 20s, I fainted. Turns out I had a 250 blood sugar level. I was Type2 diabetic. I had tried to be vegan, vegetarian, fat free, carb free, 30 days green, etc etc you name it, Ive done it. I still do try to be healthy , even if im not purely vegan or veg. And what do I get in return? Random spikes of hyperglycemia :) 

Ive been able to control and uncontrol my diabetes, depending on my hormones, my stress levels, and my general shitty body depending on how it feels that day. There is no magic cure. There is no diet or exercise plan that you can buy that will make it all go away. We just have to cope with it and pray next day is better than the bad days. Its miserable but its manageable. Im just sick of the influencers trying to sell us shit for clout, money, or followers. Just do what your own body wants most. No one else can tell you what that is."
Lausannea,2022-05-11,16,"It's #1. There's no equivalent to a cure. The diabetes is always there, you're just reversing the symptoms. A type 1 who has perfect nondiabetic levels is no less type 1 just because their treatment plan is top notch and making them symptom free. The same is true for a type 2.

A lot of GPs are not diabetes specialists but use words like reversal, either cause they don't really understand it themselves, or they don't want to bother explaining it.

Others are self-made doctors or people who have things to sell.

Many of the holy grail doctors in type 2 spaces aren't diabetes specialists, but things like kidney doctors who speak half-truths and make a shitton of money selling misconceptions that work just enough to make people believe everything they say is true.

There's a lot of greed involved in type 2 management plans. They also play into the stigmas and shame. People much prefer to be cured of a condition that is seen as a moral failure, rather than being told they have it for life and need to work on maintaining it for life, which means they enable the greedy ones who are not being entirely truthful. It's a vicious circle."
ECrispy,2022-05-11,2,"what is the 'irreversible' part? what causes insulin sensitivity to be permanent? is it change in pancreas or in every other cell which causes them to stop storing glucose?

Since everyone agrees that this is genetic, there must be cellular/metabolic changes linked to your genes, right?"
Lausannea,2022-05-11,8,"Insulin resistance is a normal part of human physiology. Everyone has it, it's beneficial to help our bodies function and make better use of glucose, e.g. when we wake up in the morning, it helps preserve energy before we get to have our first meal of the day by not making our body use up all the released glucose reserves immediately.

The problem with type 2 diabetes is that the resistance is chronic and exceeds the average levels. We don't exactly know why. We know that genetics are at play, and we know that environmental factors increase the risk of its development. That can include lifestyle, but it also includes medication use (like steroids), insomnia, stress, pollution, viral infections etc. There are dozens of variables that affect its development from being normal to being abnormal and chronic.

What treatment does is not so much restore the sensitivity back to normal by removing the underlying (currently unknown) cause, it simply treats the symptoms by encouraging higher sensitivity. That is what differentiates a non-diabetic from a diabetic. A non-diabetic doesn't have to do anything special to maintain high insulin sensitivity naturally, they don't need to follow the type 2 long-term treatment plan. 

A type 2 diabetic who abandons their treatment plan and adopts the average non-diabetic will inevitably return back to being symptomatic.

There are exceptions, such as patients who had a gastric bypass. Gut bacteria are believed to also play a huge role in this system, and a gastric bypass has been shown to help type 2s be symptom free as well. Since a gastric bypass also includes a lifelong commitment to a strict diet, I'm uncertain about what can be attributed to the long-term symptom removal here; is it a cure of the type 2 because the gut bacteria are permanently changed by the surgery, or is it the combination of the surgery + maintaining the lifelong diet?

Either way, the human body is... incredibly complex, and type 2 diabetes is too. There are plenty of fit, healthy, young individuals who do things like following vegan or vegetarian diets who still develop type 2. There are fitness nuts who develop type 2. Type 2 also has other diseases that come into play, like PCOS, which causes chronic insulin resistance due o a hormonal imbalance."
Accomplished-Job2627,2022-05-11,4,"The dawn phenomenon is not caused by insulin resistance and does not cause energy to be reserved. It is tge process of glucose production via the liver to begin producing energy for the wakeup.  Also, insulin sensitivity can be restored when the drivers of high insulin are addressed. It can be tested and proven by taking insulin testing before and after change in diet. After the change, you can see consistently lower insulin levels with normalized glucose levels."

Fergella,2022-05-11,3,"I love that you brought in the piece on those whove had bariatric surgery! I had the sleeve 6 years ago and was also told I was cured of my diabetes but the reality is that its really more in a state of remission. There are too many studies coming out about this topic to quote here but the truth is that 21-25% of diabetics will see a return of their diabetes within 3-5 years post op. The thinking is that the determining factor in those who will see a return depends heavily on how diabetic and how long someone was diabetic before surgery including any genetic factors too of course.

That doesnt mean bariatric surgery is not helpful in treating diabetes& this above quoted statistic means that in around 75-79% the surgery is a long term remission success. And as someone in the bucket of returning diabetes, I am in a WAY better position to manage it than I was before despite few behavioral changes pre and post surgery (i worked out and ate well for many years before surgery and also continue to do so now) my body is healthier than before, its more resilient in other ways which also helps, Im able to move better and easier with less pain which helps, etc. 	
If youd like to see more on the research a simple search of diabetes return after bariatric surgery will bring up a ton of hits."

Accomplished-Job2627,2022-05-11,-8,"Everyone dies not agree that it is genetic.  Yes there are some who are genetic and mor that have a predisposition but in t2, the vast majority bring it about by continuously driving insulin production higher and higher by creating demand by overconsumption of sugar and carbs particularly from grains and processed foods."
PM_ME_YOUR_DND_SHEET,2022-05-11,8,"It's #1. The language matters. After I was initially diagnosed I legitimately thought that through hard work I could no longer have diabetes and just ""reverse it"" and when I learned that I couldn't it was difficult. Then my spouse asked if I could ""just reverse it"" and I had to explain the permanence of the disease to them.

My A1C is now that of a normal person's but I am still a diabetic, and I always will be.

People need to quit saying this shit can be reversed, it implies that it will go away."
ToffeeCoffee,2022-05-11,3,"The topic seems to be misunderstood quite a lot, with regards to T2D being reversible, or ""cured"" or put into remission. In a way that's all possible, but it has to be understood what is meant.

1. For a lot of people with T2D, the trajectory they will follow is they will do some form of diet control, and start on meds like metformin, then as they get worse, go onto insulin etc. And of course that is along with all the associated illness with having poorly controlled diabetes.

2. When there is talk about reversing diabetes or putting it into remission, it's more about the health issues and long term health issues many struggle with. And a lot of that can be improved with a suitable diet that brings your BG into a healthy range. You're not cured of diabetes, but your BG is normal. For some people, especially those that have not been uncontrolled for decades (early diagnosed), it can also mean you can reduce meds, or go from insulin to just oral meds, or going off meds altogether, and controlling your diabetes just by diet.

Even most of the people who talk about reversing diabetes, they're primary message is that diabetes for T2D is a dietary disease. It can be ""cured"" by eating the right diet, not that your body will be cured of diabetes and you can go splurge out on carbs everyday. 

It's about getting your BG back to a normal healthy range, and improving your health - for many people that means from long term health issues with uncontrolled or poorly controlled diabetes. And yes, that requires permanent changes to your diet. But outwardly your BG and A1C will be or should be normal, and that's where the ""cured"" part gets controversial. Remission is a better term imo, because you're no long suffering the effects of diabetes because your BG is in a normal range, but if you go back to bad eating habits - your diabetes will rear it's ugly head once again."

Cute-Aardvark5291,2022-05-11,5,"They mean #1 which is actually ""you are eating a healthy diet, with recommended exercise levels, and only enjoying snacks and treats in limited amounts."" 

This is what sucks as T2  - not everyone eats their way into it.  But if you get to the point that you are maintaining normal A1C levels without medication, what it takes to stay that way is not,  by any means, a restrictive or strange lifestyle.  Its just the one that evidence based medicine shows that should be the standard for living for most people in industrial nations and we don't do it. 

This is why there is so many people promising fast cures - its easier to hope you can do this ONE THING to fix it then to recongize it is a change for life."
ECrispy,2022-05-11,1,"What if you don't follow a Western diet? Staple diet for vast majority of the world includes carbs - rice, bread/wheat are part of every meal.

Can you go back to that? If not I'd say thats a very restrictive lifestyle change.

I'm not talking about someone who eats pizza/burgers/fast food every day. Thats clearly bad for you for a number of reasons.

But a typical Asian/Middle Eastern/India meal, which will have carbs and be mostly plant based with lots of lentils, veggies, spices, thats a very healthy meal. But is it compatible with diabetes even in remission?"
Cute-Aardvark5291,2022-05-13,1,"you are assuming that all carbs are bad.   lentils, chickpeas, kidney beans (for example) which are all common in ME diets are all ""good"" glycemic index foods.    And those diets are also very rich in vegetables.  Like anybody else, you pay attention to your balance of what you eat.   So you aim for the better GI foods, and put more non-starch veggies in your diet.  Again, that is the type of diet that is healthy for everyone. 

You eat more steamed noodles or brown rice instead of white rice.  Portion control matters.  Eating more broth soup,  Eat more fish - which is common in many asian diets.   Again, eat more non-starch veggies.  And don't use the premade sugary sauces. 

...which is all things that sound a lot like what applies ANYWHERE"
ECrispy,2022-05-13,1,"this is how I normally eat - rice/wheat + veggies/lentils/beans, but also potato is a favorite :( Will need to reduce that obviously and I have no idea how brown rice will taste. I tried the so called cauliflower rice, it was terrible and its expensive.

brown rice and white rice are both close in GI but different sites have different values, some list both as 'medium GI'."

Accomplished-Job2627,2022-05-11,1,"It is NOT #2.  It IS # 1. While there is some genetics involved, tge biggest driver is what you eat.   The Standard American Diet of high carb, low fat eating is the greatest cause.  There was no 'switch' flip that occurred. It happened that all that glucose load drove  chronically high levels of glucose for many years resulting in insulin resistance and, often metabolic syndrome. With low carb way of eating, MOST people can regain insulin sensitivity. As an example, in 9 months, I brought my A1c from 8.9 to 5.6.  You are right, of you go back to that crappy high carb diet you will return to all the woes of diabetes."
ECrispy,2022-05-11,2,"2 questions - 

\- what is the actual mechanism that happens that causes doctors to say you its irreversible? 

\- I don't mean going back to a diet of fast food. I mean a normal lifestyle with occasional treats, but most meals are regular meals that are NOT low carb, drinking coffee/tea with milk/sugar etc. A normal diet would be called 'high carb'. Most people do not eat keto"
Lausannea,2022-05-11,3,"&gt;The Standard American Diet of high carb, low fat eating is the greatest cause. 

It's the greatest currently studied correlation. Correlation =/= cause.

Low carb also doesn't regain sensitivity. Keto diets introduce dietary insulin resistance which is separate of the chronic insulin resistance in type 2 diabetics. Whole plant based is the diet that doesn't trigger dietary insulin resistance and is equally as successful as treating type 2 as keto. Keto simply negates the need for high levels of insulin to process glucose because there is an absence of glucose.

Whole plant based is very high carb typically, but most carbs come from whole plant sources and are primarily fiber.

There is no diet that is superior to treat type 2, it depends on what works for the individual. Plenty of people can't do keto/low carb and be successful. I have a friend for whom keto makes their glucose average higher, not lower, so let's avoid making blanket statements about the primary method that isn't ""Everyone has to try things and find what works for them."""
jonathanlink,2022-05-11,2,"WFPB is not equally successful when measured for adherence. As Layne Norton is fond of saying the only diet that works is the one a person can stick to. 

Dietary/physiological insulin resistance is also such a minor issue. And protein has its own insulin demand. Making a blanket statement about WFPB in this context appears to state that it is a better treatment option.

Edit, the mod made a snide post l, then blocked me. How is that civil?"
ECrispy,2022-05-11,2,"clearly it depends, but a whole food plant based diet seems much easier to adhere to in my case. I'm a vegetarian so thats how I normally eat, and cook most of my meals. Low carb is going to be very hard to do."

ECrispy,2022-05-11,1,This is a very useful post. So there is nothing special about keto that cannot also be achieved with a plant based diet (that does not need to cut carbs)? Do you have any more links on this - as this is how I'd like to eat.
Lausannea,2022-05-11,1,"&gt; So there is nothing special about keto that cannot also be achieved with a plant based diet (that does not need to cut carbs)?

Not exactly. It's more that the idea that there's only one diet that works for all is a huge misnomer.

I have a friend who gets mad insulin resistance (as a type 1) when eating meat, so they eat vegetarian and see great improvements in resistance.

There are plenty of folks who go keto who see fantastic results. There are plenty of people who go WPB and see fantastic results.

It has more to do with an individual's body, their available resource and how long-term sustainable the diet is for them. Lots of people quit keto for similar reasons that they quit WPB. Some may find their bodies don't react well.

Here's the thing: eat to your meter. Get a glucometer, test often, and stick to a diet that is doable for you. Test your glucose before a meal, and about ~2 hours after a meal, and keep track of your meals for these readings. After 1-2 weeks of collecting data, you will see trends, and you can adjust from there.

Generally speaking, more whole foods and less processed is a great way to go about it no matter what direction you go. But ultimately it depends on what your meter says, how you feel, and what your bloodwork says after maintaining your chosen diet. Changes can be as simple as changing portion sizes or swapping an ingredient for another.

I am too tired to really go digging for links, but I've been on this sub long enough to know that there are diet cultists on all sides of this discussion who proclaim their diet is superior to another, and... I'm tired of that too. Human bodies are not simple enough to be that black and white. Just stick with what works for you, and use glucose measurements and your overall health checkups with your doctor to determine if you're getting everything you need. Whatever works for you is the perfect management plan for you.

And if you ever need medication, that's okay too; don't let people insist that medication is bad for you. Not everyone can make it work with diet and exercise alone. Sometimes you need support, and the focus here is to be as healthy as you can be. If lifestyle changes alone aren't cutting it, meds can help make you healthier, and that's really all that matters."

I am type 2 (so they say) for the last 4 years and have read and researched for thousands of hours and bottom line is we are all different. 

I have a friend who was diabetic type 2 for 8 years and with my guidance if officialy no longer diabetic. He was over weight, eat all the wrong things and did not exercise. By changing this over 2 years he is no longer diabetic. This is not just managed by being on keto or being under 50 carbs a day. This is a normal healthy lifestyle with treats now and then, but with no meds and blood work showing normal levels and reactions. 

It did not work for me as I was already on that healthy lifestyle and never over weight when I was told I was diabetic. As I said we are all different."
MrSnarkyPants,2022-05-11,1,"I'm in one of these ""reversal"" programs, but I don't look at it as reversal and roll my eyes at that word. It's management and maintenance.

But if the trade-off is giving up certain foods for things I still enjoy eating and ultimately avoiding the other diseases and complications that accompany diabetes, that's a trade I'm willing to make."
scottydoo2,2022-05-11,1,"Adding to the existing answers. I was diagnosed as, and started treatment for type 1. That was a big thing to come to terms with. Using insulin is sketchy as hell.

I knew it was something that type 1s would kill for, so I made some changes and now I live insulin and medication free, diet controlled and hba1c is 37mmol/mol. I feel like **functionally**, my diabetes is reversed, because there's such a gulf between how I was living and how I am now.

Sprig3,2022-05-11,1,"Well, the semantics of it aside, you've nailed the question.

I think it depends on the exact cause of the diabetes.  T2 is not just one underlying pathology.  

There are definitely forms of T2 that there is not even option 1 for.  And maybe there are forms where you can recover to in between 1 and 2 (maybe there are certain environmental/health factors you still need to take into account (like moderate weight loss), but you don't have to manage as tightly).

I can't really think of any example of full-on 2, though."
ECrispy,2022-05-11,1,is there hope for prediabetics? I'm obese and know the first step is to reduce weight with diet/exercise. But I'd like to hope if I do that I will be 'normal' i.e not in remission. Or will I always be at risk for T2 and can never eat pizza/snacks again?
Sprig3,2022-05-11,1,"Potentially.  One underlying cause of insulin resistance is ""intramyocellular lipids"", which are in greater concentration in obese people.

So, if that is the only cause of your insulin resistance, then removing that cause could put you back in a normal situation.

In theory, you'd still be in between 1 and 2, though.  You'd have to keep the weight off to maintain that insulin sensitivity gain.

But... there's no guarantee that your weight is your problem.  It could be a different issue.  One that you cannot necessarily control just with diet and exercise.  Something like 42% of Americans are obese, but only about 10% of Americans are type 2.  So, clearly this cannot be the only factor in causing diabetes."
ECrispy,2022-05-11,1,"how many obese people are prediabetic though? are most of them prediabetic but only 10% actually become diabetic?

how many get an HbA1c test and what would their values be? Can you persist in prediabetic stage forever  - say someone is obese and has A1c 5.8-6.4, can they stay in that stage and not become diabetic? or does everyone get T2?"

My kiddo was diagnosed at 8. What CGMs and pumps you get will depend on her insurance coverage. You might not have a choice so I wouldnt worry to much about it right this second. 

As far as patches that give insulin there is one but it is probably YEARS away from actually being FDA approved. 

But if you are with her make sure you have fast acting and slow carbs, low carb snacks, a meter and test strips(even if she has a CGM), glucagon or baqsimi(again will be insurance dependent and you should be able to get a script for a few so you have one, dad has one and the school has one), glucose tabs, if she will be on injections for a while a small empty soda bottle for her needles to dispose of safely, and ketone sticks. 

The most important thing is help her realize this doesnt define her. its just a part of who she is now. it shouldnt have to big of an impact on your relationship other than you have to more diligent about paying attention to her moods and behaviors. eventually, as much as i HATE saying this, it becomes the new norm.

vastmagick,2022-05-18,2,"&gt;Are there any gcm's that are kid friendly, convenient, and aren't too expensive. 

Continuous Glucose Monitors are out there, and can be convenient.  As for kid friendly and expensive, I think those are subjective and dependent on where you live/what insurance you have(if you are in the US).  I currently use one that stays on me for 14 days and is painless to put on, but it can be intimidating to look at it being put on(I use the Freestyle Libre 2).

&gt;Are there any sort of patches that will administer insulin. 

They have been working on injection free methods for a while and there are promising methods out there.  One method that isn't injection free, but commonly used and similar to what you are asking is an insulin pump.

&gt; I just want to know how to make her life and my dads life easier when it comes to managing this. I just can't bare seeing her stabbed multiple times a day.

The big thing that I find gets overlooked a lot is the mental health.  Your sister just got a crazy super power for her age, massive responsibility.  She's going to be great with math (she is the example math teachers are talking about math saving your life one day).  And she is going to deal with a lot of people trying to tell her how to treat herself, even if they don't know anything about her disease.  She is going to need someone that just listens to her.  You don't have to understand, and honestly you can't understand unless you go through something similar the amount of stress this disease can cause someone.  But being there to listen to her is big down the road.  

And try not to refer to her injections as stabbing herself.  It doesn't hurt but the psychological aspect of it can really mess a diabetic up.  I remember when I first was diagnosed I just broke down saying I didn't want to do shots anymore and at the time it was really my only option.  It wasn't because shots hurt, it was because of how everyone made me feel when I took my shots."
tpsrep,2022-05-18,2,Eat healthy foods and join her in learning to eat a healthier diet. Its hard being diabetic when people around you tempt you with foods that spike your blood glucose.
chronarchy,2022-05-18,1,"I'm assuming T1D here, not T2.

Well, you'll have to get used to the idea of shots multiple times per day to start with. The key thing you can do is verbally support her, and treat it all like it's normal (and maybe even cool). Have her show you how she does the shots, and ask to help (but don't be pushy). Your reaction to her T1D will be \*formative\* in how she sees herself with this, so make it the best possible reaction. Get in there and learn, and don't be afraid of it, at all.

That's not to say it's not scary. It's terrifying. But it's your job as ""Big Sibling"" to make this as easy as possible for her. Again, don't be pushy about anything. At 7, she can make a lot of her own choices about her care. You're really there to provide support and to help her navigate a whole new world. With your support, nothing has to change in terms of activities, foods, and routine. Just be there for her.

There are insulin pumps that are approved for kids; Omnipod has a tubeless option she can swim and shower while wearing, and T-Slim is another popular choice for kids. The kid usually has to wait 6-9 months before a pump is an option, though, thanks to insulin production still occurring in her pancreas, among other reasons. As soon as her endocrinologist can get her on one, make yourself available to go in for the training, if you can. And, ask for a test unit, and wear it with her.

CGMs are kind of the same deal: usually, 3-6 months to get on a DexCom or similar solution. They'll change your life after test strips, though, and you can even follow her BG at a distance. Ask her if you can see her BG on your phone when she gets a CGM (again, not pushy; this is her disease, and she needs to feel in control of it), and then check in with her before you take any actions.

For patches, check out [ExpressionMed](https://expressionmed.com/) for some cool options. They're great, and add some extra hold, and if her skin is sensitive, they also sell underpatches to help. ProTip: hit their clearance section for really big discounts on out of season styles. Even a dollar off patches makes a huge difference.

Pumps and CGMs are expensive, not matter what, and that's hard, but here's the biggest thing with a kid: they're gonna knock them off, break them, and rip them off in their sleep sometimes. Never make it feel like it's her fault, or that she's a fault for a failed pump/CGM if something happens (even if she is)."
THETHICCENINGII,2022-05-18,1,She's pretty obedient and will probably depend on us to do her shots and I don't really mind giving her shots and she won't be that afraid of it but I just hate how frequent it is. How long does omnipod last.
chronarchy,2022-05-18,2,"OmniPod lasts 3 days, or until the pod runs out of insulin. On a kid, you can officially put them on about 4-6 sites (left/right belly, left/right back, left/right leg) around the body (depending on age), and you'll want to rotate them to prevent too much scar tissue from growing. Your OmniPod rep can fill you in on that, though."

chronarchy,2022-05-18,1,"They will increase the adhesive footprint of the device, helping them hold on better. The adhesive is pretty strong on the device, but a kid can knock them off pretty easily on accident. Patches help reduce the chance of them coming off.

cheech-wizard,2022-05-10,10,"Obvious is cut out the sugar. Not always obvious is watch your carbohydrate intake- your body converts those to sugar. Bread, rice, potatoes, corn&.all will elevate your glucose. If you crave a soda, the zero products work better than diet soda. Coke, Pepsi and Mtn Dew all have one. Zero sugar flavored water is also a good option.

There is a free app called Carb Manager that has a huge database of foods including raw, processed and restaurant. Use it till you get the hang of things. The lower your carb intake, the better your glucose will behave. I try to stay under 100 grams per day, and my glucose and A1C is good enough I dont need insulin, just a daily oral med. Look into low carb or semi Keto diets.

Exercise is your friend. Doesnt have to be bust a gut strenuous&a 30 minute walk after meals will do wonders.

Water flushes out excess sugar. Ive seen 1/2 ounce of water per pound of weight recommended. If you weigh 180 lbs, shoot for 90 ounces of water per day.

IMPORTANT!!!  If you fall off the wagon and eat something you shouldnt&dont beat yourself up about it.  We ALL do it, its part of being human. Just resolve to do better, and get back on the wagon. You dont unlearn 33 years of eating habits overnight. It takes time and determination, but it is doable.

This disease is a marathon, not a sprint. Youre in it from now on&every day. Ive decided I can control it, or it can control me&.its my choice which one happens.  

Sorry for the wall of text. New diagnosis is daunting and confusing. It took me months to figure out what Ive told you above. I wish Id had this info starting out&it would have saved me a lot of time. My education provided by medical and nutrition experts was poor at best.

Feel free to PM with any questions you might have, or if I didnt explain something clearly."
Dthedaydreamer293,2022-05-10,1,Thank you so much. It is very overwhelming to say the least and my mind is going a million miles a minute. I appreciate your words of advice greatly
Rosebird17,2022-05-11,1,This is a great reply!
FuzzyDunlop007,2022-05-10,7,"When it comes to what to eat, we just had to see what foods spiked me and what didnt. Theres a lot of guessing and trial and error. Idk how much has changed since my diagnosis 20+ years ago, but my endo gave me a carb intake amount for each meal and we had to see what worked and what didnt. I think now they start with the carb ratios. Carry low snacks. I keep glucose tabs in my glove compartment. Your endo should tell you what your blood sugar range should be. Its usually 70-140 that Ive seen but I have a couple Of friends who were told their range needed to be 85-180. I always recommend a cgm if youre able to get one of those. 

If you are able, I also suggest finding a therapist. We dont really have a disease people empathize with (at least from my experience. Not saying its the same for everyone) and sometimes it can feel quite lonely. I found a therapist with an autoimmune disease so shes more understanding when it comes to (irrational) frustration. 

It can be a lot but Ive found this sub to be a great support group. People are always willing to answer questions and give advice if its not something you solely need to speak with a doctor about. Were here when you need us! d"

CosmicSmackdown,2022-05-10,4,"Once you know which type you are, learn as much as you can about that. Read, read, read.
Use your body and your meter to conduct a wonderfully enlightening science experiment - Check your blood sugar right before you start to eat a meal. Not an hour before, not 30 minutes before, but right before. Eat your meal. For a while, check your blood sugar one hour after that first bite then again at two hours after the first bite. If you have enough test strips, check it again at about four hours after the first bite of the meal. Take note of those numbers so you learn what the foods you ate do to your body. Use that information to help modify your diet. 

After a while, you wont need to check your blood sugar one hour after eating unless youre introducing a new food or perhaps a new combination of foods. 

A lot of us find that certain foods with high protein and fat that are very low in carb dont cause our blood sugar to rise at the two hour mark or even the three hour mark but may very well at the four or five hour mark. Its good to know how your body reacts and the only way you know that is by very frequent testing. Until I got my continuous glucose meter I checked my blood sugar 12 to 20 times a day. My insurance didnt cover most of those test strips and they were expensive but I had to know how my body was handling food.

Understand that were all different and our diabetes changes (or perhaps its our bodys reaction to it that changes) as time passes. For example, 22 years ago when I was diagnosed I could eat a whole lot of meat and cheese without any insulin or change in blood sugar or if there was a change it was very slight. That doesnt apply now. I need Insulin for almost every single thing that crosses my lips and the amount of insulin I need to cover 1 g of carbohydrate has changed drastically. I guess my point is dont expect that anything you know now is engraved in stone because it most likely isnt. 
Keep in mind that its not just food and drink that affect blood sugar. Stress, illness, excitement, and even the weather can impact blood sugar.

Theres a lot more but thats enough for now. Your poor brain is probably about to explode as it is. I wish you the best of luck! Hang out here and learn learn learn."
Dthedaydreamer293,2022-05-10,1,Thanks so much for the advice. Its all a lot but its controllable just gotta relax and learn. Thank you for taking the time!
Fookie9,2022-05-11,4,"I recommend getting a CGM to get a better handle on how various foods and activities are impacting your BG. It's so much better than the brief snapshots that you can get otherwise. I have a couple non diabetic friends who did this as well for a few months as diabetes ran in their families. I've never used it myself, but ppl seem to like the freestyle libre. CGMs aren't cheap, but imo, it's highly worth the expense for a couple months for the insight it will give you.

Best wishes. It can be a hard adjustment, but you'll get through it."
International_Owl360,2022-05-11,3,"This! I love, love my CGM. It gave me the positive and negative reinforcement I needed to get myself together and understand how what I ate, whether I exercised, and how I was feeling (stress, other illness, etc) affected my blood sugar.

I was 24 (super high!) the morning I went in to my doctor for the diabetic diagnosis and cried my way through my first few appointments with my GP, endo, and nutritionist as I worked to understand that, while my life was changing, it wasn't over and I could manage this. I joined ALL the Reddit groups and started educating myself.

Burnout is a real thing. Try to be understanding with yourself. Sending hugs >! We got this, everyday won't be perfect, but it will be the best you can do that day, that moment and such is the journey!"
Fookie9,2022-05-11,1,"I was diagnosed at 22 with diabetic retinopathy (super unusual and scary!) CGMs weren't around back then, so it took me a while to figure things out. Everything would've been so much easier with that real time positive and negative reinforcement you mention."

&amp;#x200B;

But seriously  lower your carb intake  as much as you can.  Loose weight since that helps control your sugar.  Gain muscle  to help control your sugar.  Try to walk or jog as often as possible.  I pair a long brisk walk with a carby meal.  Once in awhile I will have a carby meal like sushi or pizza and  for those I will walk before the meal and pretty much right after the meal.

Yankee_Viking,2022-05-10,3,"It can be tough the first few months, don't sweat it. High protein, low carb, plenty of water to learn your base line sugars.

It's normal to get frustrated. I'm a 20 year diabetic and still get irritated wheny sugars get high or low. It'll happen. Every diabetic is different in one way or another so you'll learn basics but have to tweak it to your body.

swright10,2022-05-11,3,"Look into something like Ozempic or Trulicity, its a huge help!"
Oggthrok,2022-05-10,3,"From my perspective as a type 2, they tend to give you two drugs - Metformin and Glimepiride. The first one you can be on forever, it makes your more sensitive to insulin basically. The second makes your pancreas crank out more insulin. This is helpful, for about ten years, and then in my case my pancreas kind of pooped out. Then it was time for insulin.

Early on sugar control is easy - the drugs fix you right up. Then it doesnt work as well, and you need more drugs. Then its insulin, and it works great. But, you grow less sensitive to it, and you need more, and more, and more& That is, more to eat badly. Eat low-carb, exercise, and all of this delayed, if not prevented entirely&"
Dthedaydreamer293,2022-05-10,1,Thanks. They did put me on Metformin and I have my first follow up this Friday to learn and discuss more
erectilepileoffiles,2022-05-10,2,"My first advice would be to carry a 15g fast-acting carb drink or gel wherever you go. Your a1c is a bit high, so you may feel like your sugar is low at 80-100 mg/dL. Advice #2 is if your sugar drops and you feel weak and shakey in public, don't over-eat sugar. Sometimes it'll feel like you can eat a dozen donuts when your glucose levels are low, don't. Eat one donut and wait five minutes. Advice #3 is never take your fast-acting insulin (e.g. Novolog) and leave the house. If your levels are good, you have to eat right away."
Dthedaydreamer293,2022-05-10,2,Youre saying if the levels are good and I havent eaten but taken my insulin correct?
erectilepileoffiles,2022-05-12,1,"Yup, correct"
erectilepileoffiles,2022-05-12,1,"Oh snap, I just realized you're a Type 2 diabetic. I'm dumb. The advise I gave you was from my experience as a Type 1 diabetic. I'm not sure if the same advise applies to Type 2 diabetics"
Dthedaydreamer293,2022-05-12,1,No youre good. My doctor assumes its type 2 but isnt 100% yet (but were 99% sure due to bad life choices like diet and such) and she said something relatively similar so I appreciate it!
pulsatin,2022-05-10,2,"Find out for sure if yout type 1 or type 2 get a proper medical. 
If your type 2 great, you can eat your way out of it. cut out as much sugar or carbs from your diet eat lots of fruit and veg. Exercise and loose any weight that takes you over your body weight index.
If your type 1 sorry. I have been for many years but now  with .modern tech like the medtronic 780g pump your blood sugars can be controlled and balanced. Just find out for sure what you are.

rdkilla,2022-05-10,2,don't just go eating like 5 lbs of nuts because you can snack on them and they are low carb.   body (at least mine) is not designed to handle that!

alfiekinsthethird,2022-05-11,2,"When your body has had high blood sugar for a while, you will feel like you're going low when your numbers are still high/normal.  This is your body trying to adapt to the new normal.

No one mentioned this to me when I was first bringing my a1c down, but I read about it later.  Be careful bringing your a1c down too fast.  I went from 12.4 to 5.6 in three months and it really messed with my eyes (double vision).  Give your body time to adjust to being healthy."

Dont think of the numbers as pass or fail right now. Look for improvement for the next few weeks. Stay positive.

Revolutionary_Cow243,2022-05-16,16,"Only way to lose weight is a calorie deficit, no matter how stubborn your fat is. Track your calories, which is pretty easy if youre already counting carbs - just count calories alongside. If youre at a deficit youre guaranteed to lose weight, how quickly depends on how big your deficit is. Metformin (not extended though) usually drops appetite and doesnt add weight."
SCB360,2022-05-16,2,"Yep all this I do understand but thats the issue, Im on a deficit and seem to not be affected by it, I am tracking my calories well but maybe I need to cut carbs completely"
Revolutionary_Cow243,2022-05-16,3,"From my understanding calories and weight gain doesnt depend on the source of food, carbs, protein, fiber&etc. 
Ask your doctor for a referral to a nutritionist? I dont know if its covered by your insurance or if you can afford it but online its really difficult to find correct advice especially if youre a diabetic"
SCB360,2022-05-16,1,Im in the UK so itll be covered by the NHS anyway but yea it may be an option
pythagorium,2022-05-16,4,"It has nothing to do with carbs or fats or proteins. If youre in a calorie deficits you will lose weight. Now the key is to get a good balance of protein, carbs, fat in order to keep muscle and strength while losing weight, thats the tricky part.

Fitness enthusiast here and honestly the first thing most people do is severely underestimate how many calories they are actually eating.

If you want to get serious. Dont diet at all for 1 week, just eat like normal and log EVERY. SINGLE. THING. that you eat. Like literally every single thing, the exact serving amount, grams, etc.

Weight yourself every day and get an average of what you weigh and are.

Take 500 calories off your average calorie total for that week. 500 Calorie deficits a day = 1lb in 1 week. Cardio/weight lifting are great supplements to losing weight and should be used as such, but it all comes down to diet and really tracking what you eat and ensuring you know what your daily calorie needs are."
SCB360,2022-05-16,1,"Yep I agree, Ive been tracking EVERYTHING for the last 7-8 weeks"
pythagorium,2022-05-16,4,"Also, its not unusual for the body to do weird things. I diet and bulk every year and my body will suddenly gain weight when Im deeper into my diets. The body is strange, will hold more water weight, etc, but the key is to hold strong and trust the process and in yourself that youre doing everything correct and stay the course. 

Also if you never really worked out before or havent worked out in a long time, the body is capable of building some muscle while also losing weight, but this is temporary and you should know the body cannot sustain that. Eventually the rate of muscle building will be virtually nonexistent and you will have to switch to a bulk. Good luck OP, you got this!!"

vastmagick,2022-05-16,3,"How many calories are you taking in?  Exercise is great, but if you end up eating more calories than you burn it can slow your weight loss."
SCB360,2022-05-16,1,"Im actually eating less calories than I was before, so now its under 2300 usually (usually its less than 2000 on some days) and I dont eat between 12am and 12pm 

Cutting down a bit further is possible, though really tough to figure out where"
vastmagick,2022-05-16,3,"So things to consider, and I really want to stress I am not talking bad about medication, is that your medication allows you to process more of the calories than you could before you were on the medication.

What this means is if you ate 2,500 calories(just for example) before and after going on your medication you would gain weight from the medication allowing you to use more of the carbs and protein.  Losing weight is hard, but losing weight as a diabetic is so much harder because of this.

I found that slowly cutting calories was most effective for me.  If you are at 2500, see if you can drop it to 2450 and try to do that for a week or two and when that feels normal cut again.  Rapid cuts in calories can feel brutal and tend to be short term weight loss methods that most people end up putting that weight back on."
SCB360,2022-05-16,1,"Ok that does make some more sense, so Im currently eating less than 2300 calories (usually its under 2000 if not a bit over) so should I am for under 2000 daily?"
vastmagick,2022-05-16,3,"I would aim for under 2000 daily and when you get to a healthy weight aim for 2,000 daily.  And I want to stress this, just because you are running doesn't mean you have to make losing weight a race.  Slow and steady can make it easier and allows you to build up good habits to keep the weight off."

4thshift,2022-05-16,2,"Good luck at the urologist. Muscle mass weighs more than fat as far as Body Mass volume is concerned. Did you get your thyroid checked? And testosterone?

Not had either checked yet, my Dr didnt seem too concerned about my testosterone as Im quite hairy and it grows quick (sounds like bs to me so I still want it checked)"
jonathanlink,2022-05-16,2,"First few weeks of keto I didnt budge weight maybe lost half a pound. Even after getting fat adapted I never lost more than .75 pounds except one time where I was stagnant and had a whoosh. 

I believe the whoosh is real. I cant find definitive proof, though. But the idea is that your fat cells hold onto water and dont shrink immediately. And then all at once they get the signal to shrink and you pee a bunch (even more if taking an SGLT2 inhibitor). And then youve lost weight and size. I had a major whoosh for my 4.5 month diet break (still keto) from mid-November through March. Dropped 5 pounds from mid-March weigh-in to April weigh-in. 

Lastly, I would recommend weightlifting over Couch25K. Weightlifting will build muscle faster and that will give you better longterm control. Couch25K is great. I completed it twice. I restarted it again a few weeks ago and then just ran a 5k Saturday when I found out my city has a Parkrun. So, Ill be doing that every Saturday now."

At the 6 weeks mark though, you'd expect something. I'd reach out to your doctor or a dietician and bring as much information as you can including: glucometer readings, food log (or calorie counter like mfp whatever you're using), any ""proof"" that you're exercising like fitbit or apple watch stats, etc.

Can you share what you eat? Do you count your total carbs? Net carbs? How often do you cut corners? How many meals a day?   


It sounds like you're on the right track in terms of the attitude. As a diabetic your main goal should be to be balanced in terms of blood sugar levels, the secondary goal should be to lose weight - which will definitely happen as you go through the process.  


6 weeks should be enough to see some difference, however, your goal should be to change your eating habits for good.   


Remember, the more you stick to it, the easier it becomes."
SCB360,2022-05-17,1,"Yea so basically it is 80% Keto so little carbs(Im suggested 40-50g per day) meat and veg only 

By dirty keto I mean I allow certain fruits and veg as well as the normal Keto diet so the odd pineapple or apple or potato or sometimes a sandwich (with chicken and cheese usually) as part of my carbs intake

Looking at MyFitnessPals pie chart Im hitting under 40g of carbs a day and only once in the last 30 days did I go over that by 10g, hence my confusion"
True_Rogue,2022-05-17,2,"It's good that you are moving towards less carb dependent diet.HOWEVER. If you are doing the Keto diet, there is no way for you to stay in Ketosis if you are cutting corners. ie eating fruit, sandwiches, potato pineapple etc.

Keto diet =/= diabetic diet, but this is a discussion for another time.

If you are doing Keto, you got to aim for Ketosis, which is about 22g of carbs a day. Which basically translates to non. Fruits like apple or pineapple are definitely a no-no as both contain exorbitant amounts of sugar. Sandwich breads - out the window. potato, big no.

Your ""carb fix"" should come from Keto friendly alternatives like breads made out of Almond flour, and arrowroot flour. Its getting easier to find Keto friendly options on shelves. If you aim for 0 carbs, youll probably hit 10-20 carbs a day from biproduct of foods that are keto friendly.

Sorry to be the bearer of bad news. But diabetes is a dangerous condition, but a manageable one. I am now 7 years completely balanced in terms of blood sugar levels just because there is no cutting corners.  


Here is[the Keto food pyramid](https://blog.kissmyketo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/keto-pyramid-e1588871297122.jpg). It is a very easy image to reference. Notice that there are no breads, no fruit. Notice that there is a little berry at the top, thats because berries are relatively low in sugars and arent as starchy as other fruits, but also they should be consumed sparingly. Focus on eating proteins and fats. A cheesy bacony burger with no bun, is better than a turkey lettuce sandwich."
SCB360,2022-05-17,1,"Yea I know its a bad thing to do I just find it really difficult to give those up, its rough"
True_Rogue,2022-05-17,2,"I feel you. I really do. My nephew was just diagnosed with diabetes and its hard to explain to a 9 year old why its not ok for them to eat most things when their classmates can eat whatever they want.  


It is a shitty shitty illness. But speaking from my personal experience and seeing many relatives suffer (Grandma lost her foot and died, mother in law on the way there) staying balanced is the way. The weight loss will come with the change of nutrition.  
It sounds like you are on the right track with your exercise and attitude. Once you cut the carb intake significantly youll see the biggest difference. Its 70% food, 30% fitness and 100% being surrounded by people that understand your situation, and help you get to your goal which is to **stay balanced**."

For example your maintenance calories, you would do your body weight x 14-16 (based of if your active for 1 hour per day/doing other activities) 

If we done yours based of the lower end you would be 248lbs x 14 = 3,472 calories per day to maintain your weight so eating anything under this on a day to day basis should technically have you in a calorie deficit.

So have a look into reverse dieting, say to your health team, it could be beneficial or absolutely no use as medication or anything else you might take could be responsible for you not losing weight=L"
GrumpyKitten1,2022-05-17,1,Muscle does weigh more than fat. You could track measurements as well as weight. If your weight stays the same but your measurements drop you likely gained muscle.
EvilHomerSimpson,2022-05-17,1,"Running is good, no doubt, but you should also be lifting or using resistance bands to build muscle. That might help a bit."
GeneralTai,2022-05-17,1,Do 1500 calories a day only that will work.
Angieboo2000,2022-05-17,1,"Do your other health issues interfere with weight loss? When I was diagnosed I changed my whole diet and still struggled, but when we (doctors and I) ran more tests we found out I had PCOS. That plus diabetes makes it extremely hard to lose weight. It was discouraging because I finally was able to do a short run (able a half mile) and lift my whole body weight in everything. I was physically getting fitter and my doctor was proud of me but the weight never really changed. It is still an issue for my self esteem, however my doctor is supportive and understands that I am trying so other then taking my weight down for check up reasons, he never brings up my weight. In fact he is more concerned that I overdo it sometimes but that is just because I love working out and being fit."

fixerdrew02,2022-05-05,39,"Its a cool biochem pathway. Youre essentially inhibited gluconeogenesis, so your basal compounds the issue. 

Work around is to do a temp basal :)"
AeroNoob333,2022-05-05,11,"This is the answer. Lol sometimes when I want to eat more carbs, Ill just drink some wine or have post dinner whiskey to help stabilize it a bit lol"
Gassydevil,2022-05-05,7,"Wait so your saying I should drink because it's actually not that bad for me?

Edit: I should mention that I've always been told it could outright kill me if I'm not careful and drinking in any form would raise it."
AeroNoob333,2022-05-05,9,"It depends what youre drinking. If its a sugary drink, then yeah it will raise you. But, pure spirits will only inhibit gluconeogenesis. It basically stops your liver from dumping glucose. I would NOT depend it to manage your bg. Thats not what Im saying lol! But, drinking does help stabilize sugars. You DO have to be careful because it could make your bg lower overnight if you drink for dinner or something. But as someone said, do a lower temp basal if you decide to drink."

Sprig3,2022-05-06,1,"Lol, this is so funny.  XD"
Pudrin,2022-05-05,16,liver has to remove alcohol from the blood instead of managing blood sugar levels. Higher the alcohol percentage/quantity the harder it works. Spirit and a zero sugar mixer is going to lower your blood most other alcoholic beverages contain some amount of carbs however so is only a problem with certain drinks.
deflatermaus,2022-05-05,4,"Yes, but while your liver is busy dealing with the alcohol, it delays dealing with the sugar.  You can go to bed with BG at 100 and find out that it steadily rose all night and you wake up at 250. =A"
Any_Strength4698,2022-05-05,3,Or the inverse can be true depending where you are in the metabolizing process
zeek_smol,2022-05-05,5,"Exactly this. The liver can do one job at a time, help regulate sugar or filter alcohol from your blood."
mystisai,2022-05-05,4,Sugary mixed beverages and no bolus is how I can drink safely. Then I will sill likely go low in the early morning.
FloaterFan,2022-05-05,4,From all these comments it looks like I picked a bad day to give up drinking!

jeffbell,2022-05-05,2,"I wonder if there is a target sugar content of a drink that balances it out.

But livers are tricky."
KokoPuff12,2022-05-05,1,I use my pump to combat the low with no snack. I shut down my basal an hour before I expect the drop.
funk_hauser,2022-05-05,1,"In a similar vein, does anyone know why it's hard to keep your blood sugar up when hungover? I only drank a few IPAs the other night, but the entire next day was a battle against low after low."
auscadtravel,2022-05-05,3,"Probably because you aren't eating. On days like that I lower my insulin because forcing yourself to eat hung over is the worst, and if you really went hard the night before keeping it down becomes a real challenge. For days like that I'll drink a regular sugar ginger ale soda, helps with the upset stomach and helps keep the sugars up."
more-jell-belle,2022-05-05,1,When I have gin and tonic I spike!!!! Like HUGE spike and then plummet hours later.
daertistic_blabla,2022-05-05,3,maybe because it has lots of sugar in it? try a sugarfree version! alcohol with sugar is scary! either this or that (or finding out after hard work when the spike and the low happens and acting accordingly)
more-jell-belle,2022-05-05,2,I switched to vodka sodas instead and no spike which is lovely!
Milkmannetje,2022-05-05,1,That must be your basal doing a little too much&
auscadtravel,2022-05-05,1,"Not all do, some have tons of sugar, champagne caused huge issues for me, I couldn't get my sugars to go down it was like I had eaten 3 pics of cake. Beer has carbs as well. 
Hard liquor slows your liver down in the morning so I've woken up really low because my liver was busy cleaning the alcohol and hadn't yet sent energy out to wake me up, apparently it has a priority list of jobs. This one can be very dangerous if you go to bed a bit low or danced all night."
jinkies3678,2022-05-05,1,Well this is an interesting thread. I was just diagnosed a week ago and have not had an adult beverage in that time for fear of how I will be affected. I'm taking metformin now and am not on insulin. Might have to have a whiskey this weekend and check sugar before/after.
cymon_tymplar,2022-05-06,3,Might consult with your Dr as well. Apparently metformin and alcohol don't play well together. [Metformin and Alcohol](https://www.healthline.com/health/diabetes/metformin-alcohol#alcohol-interactions)
bling_bling2000,2022-05-05,1,"Your liver is always giving you a bit of sugar. When you drink, it focuses on digesting the alcohol instead, so the sugar stops. 

I tend to drink beer, which obviously has carbs, but it'll raise my sugar not much more than the alcohol itself lowers it. Best answer I can give is to trust your body and have food ready if you plan to drink."
soldier4hire75,2022-05-05,1,"I have a weird reaction to alcohol. If I'm drinking beer I'm pretty stable, even when drinking heavy beers. Liquor, if it's a clear one, it lowers it, a dark one (think whiskey/bourbon) it raises it. Wine wrecks me tho (don't have it very often anymore).  I just do a temp basal when I drink tho. I hate chasing lows with food. It's counter-intuitive."
Matezza,2022-05-05,1,"One of your livers jobs is to slowly release sugar into your blood stream. This is why you need a basal insulin to combat that constant sugar release. 

When you drink alcohol your liver has to process this. While it's doing this it can't do everything else it's supposed to do. Because you already have basal insulin In your system this causes blood sugar levels to drop. This also affects non diabetics but to a lesser degree. Your pancreas can stop production of insulin to combat this but low blood sugars contribute to why hangovers suck. 

This is why alcohol can be dangerous for diabetics. The symptoms of low blood sugars can be similar to those of being drunk. The combination could put you in a position where you can't care for yourself and people just think you are drunk. 

The effects of this will continue for as long as you are processing alcohol. 

It's a difficult balancing act as everyone is affected differently and many alcoholic drinks contain a lot of sugar. Personally I haven't really gotten drunk since diagnosis. 2x ciders is about my limit and the sugar mostly combats the alcohol. If you've been drinking it's often best to go to bed slightly high. 



On a side not glucagon which can be your emergency hypo solution is a hormone that releases sugar from liver. After using this you do need to then eat sugar as well as once the hormone has dispersed the liver will start to reabsorb sugar for later."
crowdsourced,2022-05-05,1,I drink as much Maker's Mark as a I like with no effects.
captian_insulin,2022-05-05,1,"Your liver released sugar constantly and that liver is why you need a basal or long acting insulin so when you drink your body focuses on filtering your blood more. Any kind of medication filtered through the liver can be a problem to.

Like fixed drew said you're basal is still working even though your liver is not producing sugar anymore."
zerofoxxgiven,2022-05-05,1,"I actually dont mind it. It allows me to drink (usually straight, not mixed) and eat to help levels stabilize without having to take additional insulin. Its kinda nice."
Yikegaming,2022-05-05,1,"This is how it was explained to me, our bodies are super dumb and can only worry about one thing at once, and when you're drinking, the alcohol takes priority and our bodies don't do what they usually do which is trying to keep our blood sugar from crashing by using excess sugars."

That prompted me to look it up which is how I found out about this and thats where I found this article. But apparently this has been around in development for a couple of years. Nothing has been officially approved by the FDA yet but they are hoping that at some point down the line this can be approved. The one thing you have to know about the article is that it seems more of a one time use thing. You can change the color of the tattoo based on your blood glucose level but they havent quite figured out how to make the color revert back. 

That sort of defeats the purpose as you would only be able to tell once about your blood glucose.  But the idea of a tattoo that changes color every time in glucose is high or low sounds like a great thing and if it really does get pushed through I would have no hesitation to get one."

designgeek89,2022-05-12,2,Yes and from my understanding they have been able to get the tattoo to change color based on your glucose level but they havent quite figured out how to make it revert back to the original color yet? So it sounds more like this is a one time use thing which would defeat the purpose of getting it if you can only use it once to check your blood glucose and once the color changes youre pretty much stuck with whatever color change to. Hopefully they can keep this thing going and someday we can see them actually get this approved by the FDA and hopefully at some point they can figure out how to make the colors revert back so this can be successful.

Kaleandra,2022-04-29,50,"The ability to see which direction your blood sugar is headed as well as being able to see as many data points as you want without stabbing your finger tips to hell seems very worth it to me. Also, on the go convenience."
DaPeaceGuy_Edits,2022-04-29,7,"Yeah, my fingers have red dots from all of the stabbing"
Kaleandra,2022-04-29,3,A CGM will help keep those from developing into calluses.
DaPeaceGuy_Edits,2022-04-29,2,"OK, I'll talk with my docs about having one today"
puehlong,2022-04-29,12,"Yes imho the difference is night and day. I would even recommend a Dexcom if you can get one because it transmits readings automatically while you have to manually read out the Libre via NFC. But having a Libre beats only having a glucose meater by far. I did 19 years of T1 without an FGM or CGM, and I would never go back. Advantages are

\- you can understand your sugar and the causes for spikes a lot better  
\- the automated alarms mean you can somewhat keep your mind off your diabetes because you get notified when it starts to go wrong  
\- you and your endo get a much better understanding of how well your therapy is working and how you can reduce your overall levels (if necessary)  
\- if you have a problem with nighly hypos, your Libre will wake you up and make sure you can treat them on time  
\- once you have a CGM, you can think about trying out a closed loop where an App helps you automatically correct unexpected spikes in your glucose levels which again gives you so much freedom of mind"
pebblebypebble,2022-04-29,1,You can add night rider to Libres to get bluetooth
B0ktopus,2022-04-29,6,"Absolutely! I've had diabetes T1 for 8 years, and have been using Libre for the last 2 years. Not having to jab my fingers every time is definitely worth it, and the convenience of just checking it with your phone is great. My doctor can even discuss my readings with me over the phone whenever i have questions about my diabetes. Give it a try, you'll love it compared to the testing strips."
DaPeaceGuy_Edits,2022-04-29,1,"Yep, but my friend had a low sugar case (also T1) on the libre showing 66 but on the finger stabber (goofy nickname) it showed 105, I kinda sceard cause of it"
KuroFafnar,2022-04-29,2,"There is lag and the Libre tries to predict glucose.  So it is kinda bad if you are spiking in one direction and then another because the Libre will still predict along the old trend.

Reasonably accurate for 15 minutes ago, but if you need the info for right now then nothing beats a finger stick"
baabzie,2022-04-29,6,"Have had type 1 for a year and got a libre at once and can't even imagine how much worse this disease was before this invention.... I'm usually 97% - 100% in range.

One annoying thing is that it's quite common for me to wake up at night because of it but I'll guess that is a blessing in disguise. 

I'm in Sweden thought so the libre is payed for by the tax money"
Paid-Not-Payed-Bot,2022-04-29,-4,"&gt; libre is *paid* for by

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*"
Interesting-Walrus23,2022-04-29,5,"If youre able to get a dexcom rather then a Libre I recommend that. I used the Libre before dexcom and it was okay at best, the readings were often very inaccurate and the sensor would always lose connectivity but on a whole CGMs make managing diabetes so much easier because your can see your trends. You would have to stab your finger a million times to be able to see the same readings as a cgm graph"
mhandlon,2022-04-29,2,fingersticks &lt; Freestyle Libra 2 &lt; Dexcom g6
ravenitrius,2022-04-29,4,Its fantastic. I have it and it help me during my nightly lows. Also never have to prick your finger ever again except for accurate testing confirmation. Plus I had it on when I was in DKA at the hospital and the nurses called it a wonder device as it matches their devices numbers.
TheBigYinnie1106,2022-04-29,3,"I have been using the FSL since 2020. You will need both the sensor and the clugose meter. The FSL is great in giving you an idea what can cause spikes (highs) and lows, but you will need the backup of a finger prick when the sensor tells you something different from how you feel.

When having a hypo you need the blood glucose meter to see where you are right now, instead of an trend arrow that might give you the wrong information.

The FSL is great, but on it's own not sufficient to measure your blood glucose. Abbott advises the finger prick even.

Just that you can use the finger prick as double check, in stead of being the main way of checking your blood glucose and damaging your fingertips."
thatawesomeperson98,2022-04-29,2,This. I was told Id never need a finger prick again. Very quickly learned that is extremely false and especially during the first 24hrs Abbott advises finger pricks before making any treatment decisions as the sensor can be off due to insertion trauma apparently.
Rockitnonstop,2022-04-29,1,"&gt;Back

To be fair Dexcom is the same as well. I personally trust my body out of all the cgms. Freestyle 2 is my preferred cgm. Then Freestyle 1 and Dexcom g6 last. I think it is important to note that all cgms have good and bad sides, what works best for a diabetic, really depends on their personal preference."
Gnarism,2022-04-29,3,Ive been using them for a little over a year now (T1D for 11 years now) its a complete game changer. As someone said above the ability to see the direction your sugar is heading is so useful. I still pack strips and a glucometer but the CGM is irreplaceable in my experience.
Animelover1104,2022-04-29,3,"I would recommend dexcom bc it has better accuracy than the Libre. Ive been on Dexcom for 4 years and its been great for me. Plus if u plan on getting any kind of pump soon, depending on which one u get, it will connect to the Dexcom."
EddyF1208,2022-05-02,1,"This whole conversation is timely; thank you all. 

I've hade 4 of the last 8 Libre1 fail out of the box. I cracked a sad and didn't purchase any more. I had been using the Libre1 for 2 years.

Just started on G6 today and the ""No Calibrations Needed"" is a lie; but I already knew that. I am sufficiently impressed with the whole G6 experience to be certain I will continue.

All that said, to answer OPs qquestion, Yes! Absolutely it's worth it. 'It' being time, cost, logistics, the whole lot."
thatawesomeperson98,2022-04-29,3,I have one and love it but at least once a day i check against finger pricks for accuracy (i have trust issues due to a few bad sensors a while back though so thats why) also beware you might get a bad sensor especially if your using the 2 (thats the reason i switched to the 14 day libre 1 instead but it doesnt have alarms so i have to wake periodically and check if Im high or low though one thing Ive found to work is to eat somthing with fat or protein in it the night before that helps keep my levels somewhat stable but what works for someone might not work for someone else )
dima_taji,2022-04-29,2,"Ive been using Libre for a couple of years now, and recently I got approved for a Libre 2, and I highly recommend it. But as others mentioned, sometimes the reading isnt entirely accurate, and I find that happens usually when mu BG is either too low or too high, so I do supplement with finger pricks when the reading doesnt make sense to me. 
If you can get Dexcom, I used it for about a year before the Libre, but I had to stop because I am currently in a country where its not available, and if I buy it online my insurance wont cover it, but I preferred it to the Libre."
cascajal,2022-04-29,2,VERY! Especially now that you are getting started.
The_Oomgosh,2022-04-29,2,YES.
FlashcrySamurai,2022-04-29,2,"Absolutely. The additional amount of data that you get with a CGM is absolutely worth it. Seeinging post-eating and overnight tends is super helpful to figuring out basal insulin doses, and you just can't get the same amount of information through finger sticks.

Example: I've started working out more recently, so I need to consider lowering my basal insulin dose. Once a week I look at how my blood sugars have been overnight, and if they generally tend down, I can reduce my dose. But I also get a dawn effect, so if I was only checking at 10am, I wouldn't really know what my sugars did overnight."
opsb,2022-04-29,2,"Imagine driving a car with a speedometer that only showed your speed twice in a journey, that's what using just finger pricks is like. If you want to understand what affects your glucose levels so you can make better decisions and be safer then there's no question, having a Libre is essential."
Eeazymane,2022-04-29,0,Keep it mind the sensor reads different from a finger prick. I noticed the libre always reads higher sometimes very much higher than a finger prick and it honestly doesnt help me just stresses me out more because my alarms are going off that im high but its no true and I cant verify all the time since I dont carry my glucometer all the time.
chrisagiddings,2022-04-29,3,Im told they tend to be about 10-15min behind the fingers if your site is on the arms. Youre looking further into the past.
cenderis,2022-04-29,1,"There's also some kind of prediction algorithm involved. One person suggested the best time to respond to a Libre graph is tomorrow (don't believe completely what it's saying about now). Having said that, responding to what look like upcoming hypos and things makes complete sense, but it's as well to try not to overreact since the recent graph is very much subject to revision."
chrisagiddings,2022-04-29,1,"Yeah, I've noticed that sometimes readings on the graph seem to adjust after I've scanned the sensor. It's still confusing to me how a point in time measurement can change after the fact. lol"
Keonexis,2022-04-29,1,If you dont have it already&I HIGHLY suggest you talk to your Health Insurance Provider to see what they can do to cut dat cost down.
G-ShortWarning,2022-04-29,1,"Im saying yes, with a caveat. 

I would say Im more stressed with my diabetes since going on libre. My hba1c has always been good and hasnt changed since getting a libre but theres a lot of information. Lots of spikes I was not aware about because Id only be testing around eating (by which time my bg will have dropped).  They stress me out and cause me to micro manage maybe a little too much. 

Couldnt go back to life without one now though."
BubbaChanel,2022-04-29,1,"I have a Libre, only did finger sticks for a couple of months early on in my diagnosis in June of 2020. I use the app on my phone as a reader, and all of the info goes straight to my doctors office.

Interestingly enough, I just got my 3 month refill, and the pharmacist said she thinks the Libre 1 is being phased out because they havent gotten any readers in a while, and something about expiration dates on their current stock of actual Libres. Its a bit pricy for me, $80 a month, but well worth the convenience."
igloohavoc,2022-04-29,1,"I got a Libre just for this reason, data points without cumbersome finger sticks"
pebblebypebble,2022-04-29,1,"Yes, but the app sucks. Im looking at using the Vibe service& but a free better app with the Libre would be better. Use Nightrider to not have to scan."
crimsonscyes,2022-04-29,1,"Using a Libre is MUCH better than a normal glucometer but after trying the free 14 day trial I wasn't impressed by it. The official app won't work for me at all because it's region locked (I'm currently overseas) so I have to use a third party app and even that doesn't work most of the time. More than half of the time it won't scan and I can't get a reading. Also one time I checked a normal glucometer to see how accurate the Libre was and it was about 30mg/dL off.

I'd recommend trying the Dexcom G6 if you're able to, but the Libre is still better than pricking your finger and getting a snapshot of your current blood sugar level with a normal glucometer."
willyfisterass,2022-04-29,1,Yes ive had for  2 months its totally worth it. Love it for sure
AssociationItchy,2022-04-30,1,"I wear a libre 2 , I also do mma /bjj in a gi , with all the sweating and constant fighting it does fall of sometimes , I have a bumper I wear on the sensor, and use skin tac along with wearing a long sleeve rash guard"
Noggin-a-Floggin,2022-04-30,1,"It's much easier and a hell of a lot more detailed with the data you get.

You scan the sensor on your arm and get an instantaneous blood sugar.   The alternative is to finger-prick and test the blood itself which is a whole process that needs space and time.  With the Libre you not only avoid that but you get a graphical read-out of what your blood sugar has been trending at plus get an arrow beside the reading showing where you are trending.  Like if you are shooting up it has an arrow pointing up and you can decide the treatment you take for that."

crimsonscyes,2022-05-13,2,Whenever this happens to me it makes me question if I even have diabetes anymore. =
The1983Jedi,2022-05-13,1,"I just had my A1c &amp; it was 6.8. But without that, I'd think the same thing."
EvilHomerSimpson,2022-05-14,1,"Honestly I'm feeling that way.

I had one A1C of 7.4, but my next was 5.1 and I've never had a ""high"" over 140 from a finger prick even after having something like mashed potatoes with Christmas dinner. Hence my doctor said ""diet controlled""

Granted 14/15 days I am strictly carnivore and have dropped about 50 pounds in the past year. 

But going through insurance checkups I feel stupid checking diabetes."

The1983Jedi,2022-05-14,4,"Part of it carb dosing. I don't have a scale, it's just almost instinctive. 

But I worked really hard at watching what I ate, taking my meds correctly &amp; when I should, and not cheating very much (one meal &amp; one snack, that's where I carb dosed)"
GyrosCZ,2022-05-14,1,"How long do u have it? It worked for me for some time,, but curently not anymore. Masive morning spikes makes it nearly unberable.

The1983Jedi,2022-05-14,1,"Unfortunately now secrects. Watch my carbs, take my meds appropriately. Dr taught me about carb dosing."
pabaman,2022-05-14,1,Congratulations and thanks for the motivation! I have a little bit of a stupid question (new to trying to manage this disease): what do you use to get a report like this? Ive just been doing finger sticks several times a day. Do these kinds of reports come with a CGM? Ive been trying to get my doctor to prescribe one but they keep saying its unnecessary (though my diabetes is horribly uncontrolled). If CGMs give reports like this i would find it hugely valuable to better understand and track the disease.
jellyn7,2022-05-14,1,"Not the OP, but yes, it's a CGM app. My doctor understands I like data like this and took no convincing at all. My health insurance means I pay about $38 out of pocket for each sensor. I first tried the Libre Freestyle free sample though. Then submitted some of the pdfs to my doctor so she could see them. Maybe see if you can talk them into prescribing it once for the free trial at least?"
RookieSonOfRuss,2022-05-14,1,"If youre a diabetic and your doctor wont prescribe you a CGM you need to find a new doctor.  There is no scenario under which having more information isnt going to be a big benefit.  Hell, Im NOT a diabetic (daughter is T1D) and Im thinking about making a play for one."
The1983Jedi,2022-05-14,1,"It is a CGM &amp; has LOT of different graphs &amp; data you can access. This is the freestyle Libre 2. If you want to DM me, I can show you the other graphs. It has them for 7, 14, 30 &amp; 90 day, and a place to put in the insulin your using &amp; carbs for your meals"
Single-Presence-8995,2022-05-14,1,You making type 2 look easy...
The1983Jedi,2022-05-14,2,My 90 day average bar graph is pretty much all in the yellow. It's been a fight
mystisai,2022-04-26,13,"The ""bragging"" posts are mostly facetious. Its a long-running joke.

Back when I used a lacing device, I mostly just forgot. There were times it was about cost for me, and that's when you already have to choose between scripts and food. Something I didn't get from my scripts was lancets, so lancets were skipped. It was easier to get a new glucometer yearly than it was to get a script for lancets. So 10 lancets had to last a year.

I use a lancing device once or twice a year now that I use a cgm."
SenileTomato,2022-04-26,-1,Makes sense.
friendless2,2022-04-26,10,"The risk of infection seems low since so many people don't change them often and we don't see lots of reports of infections.  Readings won't be different with a used versus a new lancet.

I change my daily \*)gasp(\* now.  Mostly because I don't want to deal with sharps disposal during the day away from home.

15 years ago, I changed lancets when the started to hurt or need the depth increased, about every 3-6 months.  I was reusing the lancet because they were kind of pricey at the time (and not covered by insurance), especially when the cost of the other supplies were so high as well ($200/mo strips, $40/syringes, stupid expensive insulin...) so if they still worked, why change them?  Especially since I made 1/4 of what I make now back then."
myohmymiketyson,2022-04-26,1,"I try to change it once a day, but it's more like once every few days. I'm just lazy about it."
SenileTomato,2022-04-26,-5,"That makes sense, I guess my OCD would kick in and I would have to more often ha."
Thriss13,2022-04-26,10,"I get lancets for free, so I had no good reason to not change mine except that it was just one more step in a process that already felt like a hassle when I was on the go, in the middle of teaching, trying to get housework done, etc. I honestly only started changing them regularly when I changed my job to one with less stress...and I was tired of my supply of lancets building up, and didn't want to throw them away... XD"
friendless2,2022-04-26,4,"I have 1000's that I donate to various organizations.  The needy locally, I have also sent a few thousand with nursing students going to underprivileged countries.

I get 1 lancet per strip, but only use 1 per day, so there is quite a build up."
Thriss13,2022-04-26,3,"Oh, I should look into that... Are lancets 1 size fits most? I get mine through Livongo, so I'm worried about how they like to make everything proprietary..."
myohmymiketyson,2022-04-26,3,"I also use Livongo, so I just tried inserting a Livongo lancet needle into a spare lancet device of another brand. It fit. It isn't shaped exactly the same, but it worked just fine. Good news!"
friendless2,2022-04-26,2,"Livongo too.  I have had them skip the lancets once when I had to order a 2 month supply for an extended vacation out of the country.

I must have 1500 stored now, and 2 boxes to empty and another box on the way."
MacManT1d,2022-04-26,16,"It's just kind of a thing.  Maybe it's a sign of toughness, maybe not, I'm not honestly sure.  I couldn't tell you the last time the lancet in my testing kit was changed out, and I doubt I've bought a box of lancets in the last five years (I've been using the Dexcom for two of that, and have only tested maybe five times a month, but still).  I couldn't tell you why I don't change it, I just don't.  It's a pain to change and get rid of compared to leaving it in the lancet device, maybe that's it.  I just don't ever seem to have a good enough reason to deal with changing it.  I've had exactly zero problems with using an old lancet in 40 years of treating type 1, so there's that, too.  I don't get sore fingers, I never had an infection, I get plenty of blood the first prick, etc.  Like I said, I've never been faced with a good reason to change them very often."
SenileTomato,2022-04-26,4,"Well that definitely sounds logical and practical, thank you for the explanation."
saintr0bot,2022-04-27,5,I'll chime in to add to this on the side of confusion too haha. Reading all of the replies is eye opening. It's never crossed my mind to not change my lancet. Like OP I also use the fastclix when I'm not using my cgm.
SenileTomato,2022-04-27,1,Glad to hear I'm not the only one. Haha
Interesting-Walrus23,2022-04-26,5,This post reminded me I should change mine lmao

Azurite10879,2022-04-26,3,"I think a part of it is just laziness (I'm guilty of that) and really it works for a long time. Also that it's a pain to change the lancet as times. 

So really what everyone else has been saying."
SenileTomato,2022-04-26,3,"Makes sense. That's why I use a FastClix landing device. Has 6 lancets in one drum, makes it much easier."
SgtSloth,2022-04-26,3,"I used to do it just cuz I was lazy as hell. Now that I don't have to stick my fingers almost ever, changing it out every time I do need to on the rare occasion is pretty simple."
suchahotmess,2022-04-26,3,"Im a little bit obsessive in comparison but I change mine every session. If I get a weird reading and I want to double check, or if I get an error message and need to start over Ill use the same one. But if I test in the morning and then again in the evening, Ill use another one. 

Right now I only test fasting, since Im just starting to get it under control and my doctor didnt tell me to do more. If I did have to test multiple times a day Id probably use one a day. But using a lancet and then coming back to it 24 hours later feels gross to me personally."
SenileTomato,2022-04-27,1,"I definitely feel the same way - especially when I test and it seems lower or higher than I feel, I feel the need to test again. If I had used the same lancet, I would even feel more of a need to double check, wasting more test strips, which are much more expensive. Therefore I always change my lancet."
nallvf,2022-04-27,3,"When you are testing a lot, it becomes a pain to change out the lancet every time. It's not about expense it's about the small amount of required effort repeated multiple times every day.

When you are testing infrequently, it feels kind of unimportant. After all you can leave your lancet for ages when testing daily.

I have legitimately not changed my lancet in a few months, I have a CGM so I test infrequently. I even have one of those lancing devices that has a drum of lancets and you just need to turn it to change it, I still don't bother.

There is no worry about having incorrect readings or scarring or infection from lancets, at least not from me. Back when I was doing MDI I reused insulin pen tips a lot as well, 1 or 2 pen tips per pen.

It'll probably happen to you too and you won't even notice it. Lots of diabetes management becomes rote, many end up cutting corners where we can."
KaitB2020,2022-04-27,3,"Personally& 

I just forget."
Youjustpokedthebear,2022-04-27,3,I change mine every time. I guess its just habit and I have the fast clix so you easily just slide the tab over and it clicks to the next one. I also find that if I keep them in for a few uses they hurt more each time (dulling needle?)
SenileTomato,2022-04-27,2,"That's what I use, great landing device.

And yes, the lancet definitely loses it's sharpness after each use."
LOKP3ST,2022-04-27,3,"My doctor said, of the record, that I could use the same lancet at least three times. But here in Sweden lancets are free of charge, same with the reader itself. So i change every time ="
SenileTomato,2022-04-27,1,"Nice! Yeah I change mine every time too. I use the FastClix landing device which has 6 lancets in one drum, so I don't have to change it for 6 tests."
tredding94,2022-04-27,2,I just forget that I'm supposed to change them.
Mereology,2022-04-27,2,"Back before I had a CGM, I'd just change my lancet when it got dull enough to hurt.  So every year or so.  The hassle was the only reason why I'd wait.  

I've seen zero evidence of any of those side effects occurring from reusing lancets.  Hell, a nurse who was also diabetic was the first person to tell me not to bother changing it every time.  You'd think we'd see problems occasionally if the risk was measurable, no?  CGMs and pumps get infected all the time but I haven't even run across a case study of a lancet poke infection, and we're a very infection-prone population.  I tend to avoid shortcuts where the risk concerns me enough but an old lancet is just not on my worry radar."
5of10,2022-04-27,2,i clean the metal tips on mine for reuse.
cbelt3,2022-04-27,2,I just change mine every few days. Mostly out of laziness.
this_is_squirrel,2022-04-27,2,"I think a large part of it is laziness, but also the original lancets would take your entire fucking finger out and just like the old needles you could use them over and over and over and over and over again. But they were all so fucking massive. The needles and lancets are much more delicate than when I started poking my fingers, and my behavior never really caught up."
Environmental-Pie988,2022-04-27,2,I would skip a test rather than skip changing lancet.
SenileTomato,2022-04-29,1,Same!
niff20,2022-04-27,2,"I honestly used to forget because I was never the best at testing like I should have been. Once I really started re-learning about my diabetes and the importance of not reusing supplies, I got into a habit of changing it every time. I then realized nearly all the frustration that came from having to re stick myself etc came from a dull lancet. It hurts way less now and I get blood on the first time. Otherwise, I do still reuse them when I'm feeling lazy or don't have a place to keep used ones - which is rare because I'm on the dexcom anyway"
pixelatedchrome,2022-04-27,2,Just me being lazy. I change when it starts to hurt.
nrgins,2022-04-26,2,"I haven't changed my lancet in probably about 10 years. No need to. Not a question of money, just the hassle of changing it out every time."
EatABigCookie,2022-04-27,1,It's not the price. I'm lazy. No infections yet after 10 years and I can go months without changing it.
MildlySuspiciousBlob,2022-04-27,0,who cares
38willthisdo,2022-04-26,1,"Its just not something my fingers feel is important (if my fingers felt any pain I would change the lancet), so I guess that makes changing the lancet a low, low priority for me."
HighLows4life,2022-04-27,1,I use to every time at first then forgot and nothing bad happened so let it ride. But now I have cgm and I usually put a fresh one on more often because I use it about 4x a month.
Rad2323,2022-04-27,1,I change my lancet every 3 to 4 days simply because I have so many.
Ok-Ratio-4998,2022-04-27,1,I was doing it long before I knew anyone else was doing it and it seems to be something that most diabetics tend to do. After many years you just stop changing it so much and you forget about it until one day you realize its been weeks/months since you last changed it. Been checking my blood for over 24 years without experiencing any infections and my fingertips look great. Just wash your hands.
Shawnanigans_,2022-04-27,1,"Before I got a cgm, I just didn't like the extra bit of time in what was already a slow process. Like in a restaurant,  trying to be unobtrusive, so test kit in lap, change lancet, test, put away, then change needle and inject.
Never had a problem, so I started changing lancet and needle less frequently. 
Now with cgm, I just glance at my watch. Slip the pen out of my pocket, dial and inject. Most people never even notice, though I'm not actually trying to hide anything."
Bexileem,2022-04-27,1,"I only change my lancet when I open a new packet of test strips. I usually use a cgm so it can be months (but minimal use) its honestly that I forget. Ive never once in 24 years had an infection from not changing a lancet and only pay $5 per script for lancets. Definitely not the cost either. 

Laziness and forgetfulness with a bit of I use a cgm 99% of the time so meh"
Run-And_Gun,2022-05-17,16,"And like the federal bill making the rounds, it appears to only cover those that are already insured or on state/government medical plans.

CatFaerie,2022-05-17,11,Which is ridiculous. People without insurance need the protection even more.
jardex22,2022-05-17,2,A good number of plans include at least one brand of insulin that's free under preventive meds.  This seems like the green light to raise that to $30 instead.

jihiggs,2022-05-17,7,"Which will lead to insurance companies no longer covering new insulins like lantus or semglee, only the old stuff that Walmart already sells for 30 bucks a vial.  Nobody wins, yaaaaaay progress!"
darthyoshiboy,2022-05-17,3,"I didn't look at this legislation, but Utah passed a similar law and it requires providers to cover at least one insulin from each class of insulins where R &amp; NPH are not in the same class as lispros &amp; glargines. So while your provider may not opt to carry your preferred insulin, they do have to carry something in the same class of insulin and it's worked great for me. My provider is a national plan and they haven't bothered to try and change any coverage in the 2 years since the law was enacted, I just pay significantly less for the drug I need to live."

Any_Strength4698,2022-05-17,-12,Im sure that will lead to more innovation in the insulin marketplace.  Unfortunately those creators of products that improve our quality of life need to be compensated.  When I first became diabetic I was prescribed nph which worked for roughly 12 hours and had a big peak.  Within six months Lantus came out with 24 hour and nearly a flat line.  I gladly paid more for that!
victorix58,2022-05-17,9,"&gt; gladly paid more for that!

Lucky you're able to do that."
Any_Strength4698,2022-05-17,-8,This was while I was a broke college student&.my Home Depot job (part time) offered health insurance.  Before the ACA drove prices through the roof there were affordable insurance plans everywhere.  Liberalism is full of unintended consequences
Chicken_Wing,2022-05-17,10,News flash: health care costs were a rocket ship before ADA. That's why the ADA was implemented. Quit spreading lies.
Any_Strength4698,2022-05-17,0,I spread truths&.look at graphs of rise in costs and biggest jumps are after ADA that accomplished nothing.   Guess what we had preexisting illness coverage before ADA.  It was called Cobra coverage.  Ive used it.
Chicken_Wing,2022-05-17,1,I found [this](https://imgur.com/a/RZOzx9s) graph. See that plateau in the middle? That's about when the ADA was passed.
LordRiverknoll,2022-05-17,6,"I had Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) before and after the ACA. Nothing changed. They were fantastic. Some time in 2018 however, our old employer switched to a smaller insurance company that cost them nickels to the dollar. We received no compensation for the objectively worse plan, and insulin was now something I had to fight for. Pump supplies? Rejected outright until I provide 30 days of pen and paper logbook activity. Test strips? Not anymore, and God help me to find a doctor in network.

And this was at a hospital, of all places. 

I'm now a highly paid engineer. The plans didn't get better. They got worse across the board while in other countries like Egypt and the EU, I can buy insulin for less than what a couple spends at McDonald's for dinner. 

Egypt, a country whose government would be too young to vote, and (Specifically in my case) Spain, a country Americans often shrug off as a socialist hellscape.

The problem is not government intervention. The insurance companies in the United States had made it their singular objective to make insurance essentially required for hospital visits and prescriptions due to exorbitant prices. They succeeded in the 20th century, and now they're just riding the high. In countries like Egypt, we see that novolog can really be sold at $20 per vial. In more developed Spain, the national government has negotiated the price down to mere euros with a prescription, or $32 per vial without."
Any_Strength4698,2022-05-17,1,"Chicken or egg scenario&.true problem is healthcare provider costs!  Insurance on a cost basis just looks at statistics of risk and covers costs and puts a profit margin on.

Chicken_Wing,2022-05-16,21,"Insurance companies often deny types of insulins already. When I had worse insurance, they said I only needed 30 units of novolog a day to sustain. My basal rate was 32 units a day. I could eat nothing and still be deficient. Now, I agree it'll likely lead to higher prices because it caps out of pocket costs rather than all retail costs on manufacturing sales like it should. They're attacking the wrong problem.

You annoy me as a 25+ year type 1.

Edit: it's not in the perview of state governors to dictate manufacturing sales since that falls under federal responsibility of interstate commerce. Governors are doing what they can in their states."
Any_Strength4698,2022-05-17,-11,"How did an insurer determine insulin volume needs&that is my decision and dr merely writes scripts for what I say I need.  When they piss me if I ask if i need to let the bubbles pop and settle so I can draw my last doses from the vial.  
Take control!"
Chicken_Wing,2022-05-17,8,Exactly my point. Health insurance is for profit and their agreements are so incompressible to the average person it's effectively not possible for the average consumer to get a fair shake. The primary issue with health insurance is that it's impossible to determine if their practice and policies are within their private agreement with the consumer. Somewhere in their policy allows them to determine the amount of insulin I'm allotted and I have no recourse. Fuck your simple thought that your medical care is determined by only your doctor and yourself. I'm giving you a primary reference on what can happen and that insulin cost me $632 for 3 months of insulin using the generic Walmart novolog. Your sight must end at the tip of your nose.

BigTayTay,2022-05-22,2,"If I do eat bread, I use dave's killer bread or ezekiel bread. Something with good fiber and lower carbs compared to normal bread. 

It's not so much how many carbs are in things, it's more about how your body personally handles certain carb heavy foods, and how much fiber is accompanied with those carbs.

I've been learning that I handle carbs much better if I have a good bit of fiber. 

For instance, my breakfast is chock full of veggies, a couple of eggs and probably a third to half cup of white rice. My sugars don't go up that much with that combo. But my body also handles rice fairly well. 

I know some diabetics that if they ate what I ate, their blood sugar would skyrocket. 

In essence, tell him to try out different foods and see what works and what doesn't.

Once I had lunch I brought to work then coworker said something about wanting McDonald's an hour later I finished 2 20pc nuggets and fries. Eventually food and water wasn't enough to keep up.  I could always eat and didn't think anything about it.  I lost about 40 lbs over a 30 days and got flu like symptoms while out of the country on business trip. Hotel staff told me it was flu and deal with it with over counter meds.  Upon calling ""house doctor"" over the phone I was told I was an American in Europe and my insurance was no good there and ""you can't afford our ambulances without insurance"" and left to die in hotel room. I was vomiting, leg cramps, sweats, hallucinations, fast heart beat, tunnel vision. Thankfully coworker found me and pulled me down the elevator in a rolling chair in my underwear out the hotel lobby.  I kinda crawled down stairs and into the car and went to urgent care doctor.   Who thought I was drunk.  Until we reassured him I had nothing to drink and no drugs.  Eventually tested me with glucose meter and immediately called ambulance.  Ambulance staff blew 2 veins on way to ER and had to pull over and stop at one point just to get IV in.  Ended up in shared room with 3-4 other people.  Eventually went into full DKA and spent several days in ICU.  Nurse Frank did not have very delicate hands on the catheter.  Then wouldn't release me cause my potassium level was too low.  Fear was if I went into cardiac event on 10 hour air plane flight I would die.  So spent another week or more in general room.  No strength at all.  Could not even pour/lift a 1L bottle of water cause it was too heavy.  I had to page nurses to even pour pitchers for me.  One point I tried going to bathroom by myself big mistake.  About passed out.  Took 3 nurses to barely help me back to bed.  I'm a big guy at 6'3 235 lbs (after weight drop) at the time."

We had to leave early because my grandpa was passing away, and on the flight back home I noticed I had to use the restroom multiple times and was drinking a ton of water. I knew immediately what that could mean, but since my mom was going through my grandpa passing away I decided to hold off telling her until like a week later (I was dumb, I shouldnt have waited). 

A week goes by and Im fairly certain at this point Im diabetic. I connected a ton of other symptoms that I hadnt realized were diabetic symptoms at the time, such as weight loss. I had dropped 40+ pounds but just assumed that was because I was running 5ks at least 4 times a week at the time. I finally told my mom and she checked my blood sugar.

leezardmik,2022-05-20,3,"Can confirm this confirmation. Currently, get injections in my ""good"" eye every 6 weeks to help slow the proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Nothing is as alarming as the first time you see the vessels inside your eyes burst and fill your eye full of blood. Just went to eye doc yesterday and got an injection, if things don't clear up by my next appointment in 8 weeks then I get to have surgery to have all of the old blood sucked out of my eye."
blazblu82,2022-05-20,2,"I have not had any shots, yet, and don't plan to. I'm worried the repeated insertions of the needle could cause retina to detach and the medication can cause ""crunching"" and more bleeding. So, I do laser instead, if my ""good"" eye can handle i; however, that has its cons too like more scar tissue which leads to tractional detachments. It's so photophobic since last hemorrhage. Lighting environments play a huge role in what I can and can't do anymore. Even going grocery shopping has its limits now.

PDR + DME has changed my life so much in such a short period of time. My DX was less than 3 years ago. Went from 2 functional eyes down to one from a failed vitrectomy. Now, I'm unemployed, can't drive and waiting to get on low vision SSDI. I want to get another job, worried that the next bleed is around the corner and I'll be down for at least 6 months again.

If you all think diabetes alone is expensive, wait until you realize how much shots and lasers are. Shots generally cost 2000+, shot setup is another 600 and lasers are 1750 per session. I never had good insurance, so my ability to afford these has played a big role. If I could go back in time and tell younger self one thing, it would be to take better care of myself."
leezardmik,2022-05-20,2,"Yeah, I've had laser done on my other eye so much there is nothing left to laser. I have no peripheral vision due to the part of the eye that handles that looking like a warzone from laser.  On the plus side, that eye doesn't bleed anymore.  Also retinal detachment and damaged cornea in that eye. (had surgery for those) I have had zero complications with the injections in my eyes and have been getting them for about 8 years. When everything is good it's once, maybe twice a year. This most recent time was the worst I've ever had, Went from OK vision to blind in that eye in about 60 seconds.  So for the past three months, I've been getting an injection every 6 weeks.  It has cleared up enough I can get around, hopefully, it continues. Don't want to have another surgery."
blazblu82,2022-05-20,1,"After having one botched surgery, I don't want another one, either. Heck, bad eye still has the oil bubble in from the vitrectomy last year. Good eye has a coloboma and dr says that makes having surgery even riskier. I have another round of laser next Friday. I hate getting lasered, lol! Mostly due to the light sensitivity, though.

How's your overall vision with good eye? Do you have visual anomalies like random black and colored spots, pulsating lights or blind spots? My visual acuity isn't terrible at 20/60 and the peripheral in good eye seems to have full range. It's the other junk I mentioned that makes seeing a problem."
leezardmik,2022-05-20,1,"When things are good I have pretty good vision in my good eye. Other than the bleeding or the occasional floater I dont recall any other issues.   


In my other eye, I have ok vision directly in front of me, zero peripheral in all directions. My shins are scarred to shit from banging into stuff I didn't see. I wear glasses and also have mild double vision due to the surgery to repair retina and cornea. It used to be severe but the brain is pretty good at compensating for it."

jessnichole,2022-05-20,3,"I'm a recovering binge eater. One of the things that had helped me the most is being mindful... Which sounds like a load of bunk, but looking into WHY you keep eating and recognizing the patterns in behavior really makes a difference.

For example, I used to crave cereal all the dang time. Especially cinnamon toast crunch. Working with a therapist,I recognized that I most craved it, and would give into that temptation, when I was settling in and getting comfortable. And oddly, anytime I watched MST3K. And when I first moved away from my hometown, when I missed my dad. Why? Then it hit me... Some of the best times I had when I was a kid was on Saturday mornings, when I would wake up early and watch MST3K with my him, eating cinnamon toast crunch most often. I was comfortable, relaxed, eating something tasty, and getting quality time with dad. It was a warm memory that I was trying to recapture subconsciously. When I start the craving, I ask myself if it's head hunger or true hunger. If I still can't fight the craving, I eat a lot less.

Definitely look into mindful eating habits."
RollerSkatingHoop,2022-05-20,2,can he read healthy but just eat way more food?  by yeah talk to an endo about his heart concerns because fat would help him feel more full. and he might not be type 2 like his dad wasn't
4thshift,2022-05-20,4,"Have you asked the doctor/endocrinologist for advice? Is he/you taking any meds?

Maybe he/you can try an appetite suppressant of some sort  a GLP-1 agonist for example, to slow stomach emptying and also lower glucose levels.

That assumes he is Type 2, perhaps, which we could not guess at. Is there a particular reason he is diagnosed as Type 2? Is he losing weight? Im T1D and was ravenous before diagnosis, gained a lot of weight, and then started losing weight as my glucose was rising. Insulin helped, but Type 1 are not only technically starving for energy due to lack of insulin, they are also losing ability to produce Amylin, another hormone that helps to delay stomach emptying. 

So, consult your healthcare professionals, it might not be just some late-night habit, and maybe there is something else afoot.

Edit: I see you said glipizide, which is kind of an odd medication  a sulfonylurea which seems to force a pancreas to work harder to make more insulin. Odd in some situations, because T2D in early years seem to suffer from hyperinsulinemia already, and sulfonlyurea are known to be associated with more weight gain. In a Type 1, it possibly would be causing more rapid beta cell death. In genetic MODY, it seems to be more appropriate. For Type 2, metformin seems to be the more common medication to start with, as it sensitizes a patient to the effects of insulin and represses liver dumps of glucose."
chunktv,2022-05-20,5,"Do you think alcohol use would have influenced the prescription of Glipizide over Metformin? He is a recovering alcoholic, still using fairly frequently, but cutting down rapidly. We're talking 150oz of beer at 8% daily down to around 50 - 75oz to start, with dry days on Sunday. Which has been a big step he's taken on his own."
4thshift,2022-05-20,2,I do not have any current need to know about alcohol and diabetes effects (quit decades ago because it induces restless legs syndrome). Someone else here can probably say so; ideally you should be able to ask the doctor why he chose glipizide rather than metformin.
chunktv,2022-05-20,2,"My husband actually did ask when we went in for his initial consultation. He and myself were both expecting Metformin based on everything we had read leading up to it. When my husband asked, the doctor only gave a kind of half answer saying he thought Glipizide would work better. Citing no other explanation. There are other signs saying this doctor may not have his best interest in mind. I think we'll definitely go for a second opinion."
4thshift,2022-05-20,3,"Just another note. Heavy alcohol use can have lasting metabolic effects on the liver, and also cause pancreatitis which can cause damage (Type 3c)  so, again, we arent the doctors and havent got the whole story and no tests. Hope you both do get to someone who can offer help and insight soon."
chunktv,2022-05-20,2,"The strange thing is, he maintains a perfect 145 lbs ( pretty average for his height ). Even before diagnosis, still having a fairly ravenous appetite. He always maintained around 145 lbs. So the main issue is typically hyperglycemia, though given long enough, it does go very low, into the 30's has been the lowest.

We've thought about trying an appetite suppressant, but we're worried that he'll lose weight at a dangerous rate if we went that route. No particular reason he's diagnosed as type 2 other than his doctor said so. His father was originally diagnosed as type 2 by the same doctor then went to another doctor. Which years later diagnosed his father as type 1."
4thshift,2022-05-20,3,"&gt; Which years later diagnosed his father as type 1.

Did he speak with the doctor about that? If that is accurate, then he is at a higher risk of Type 1 autoimmunity, as well. Him being only 145 lbs is also cause for raised eyebrows. 

Call the doctor and tell him/her this specifically, and nicely demand that Type 1 autoimmune tests be ordered today. Maybe also a stimulated C-peptide to test his insulin levels. If it is a primary/GP who doesnt want to order these tests, then get to an endo ASAP. Not trying to alarm you, or read into your situation, but we have plenty of people who didn't get the right diagnosis here saying so every week. Wont hurt to get the tests done  simple blood draw. If he were Type 1/LADA, it could take years for autoimmune onset to become more obvious, till he would hypothetically need insulin. Sulfonylurea could be masking that need."
chunktv,2022-05-20,3,"The tests definitely should be done, I agree with that. The 145 lbs thing seems normal because he's only 5'6"". I think we'll schedule with the 2nd doctor his father had and see if he can dig a little deeper. We just want to figure out how to treat this the right way. My husband just wants to be able to have pizza and fried chicken again -\_-."
suchahotmess,2022-05-20,3,"If hes constantly eating but only 145, thats also a warning sign that it might not be type 2."

thejadsel,2022-05-20,3,"Just chiming in that I was in that particular boat for years, with a couple of different doctors who didn't want to run further testing when treatments never worked properly. (And several older relatives who had already gotten wrong T2 diagnoses starting out. Autoimmune crap obviously runs in the family.) Still playing catch-up with some of the longer term effects, now that I am thankfully getting appropriate treatment.

You guys really don't want that. Hopefully he can find a doctor willing to work with him better soon. What you're describing really does sound kinda worrying, including his blood sugar shooting up that high and him feeling that ravenous in the evenings to begin with."
Sure-Treacle3934,2022-05-20,5,"Maybe the Gliclazide is not for him. I am a person who is likely LADA. I have tried several oral medications with not great results. I have now transitioned onto insulin and its working so much better for me. 

The Gliclazide made me stupid hungry. Like binge all night hungry. Also I have struggled with eating disorder behaviour when I was a young woman and also struggle now. Its tempting to eat and binge because I dont gain an ounce. I know its hard on my organs. I have a nursing background so I know how dysfunctional that is. 

On insulin, Im not as hungry as I was so its easier to control. I also dont eliminate foods, it makes the temptation to binge so much worse. For example, I love pastries in the morning with a latte. I have worked with my dietitian so that I can have one high quality pastry >P once a week. It really works! 

I dont think your husband has to give up fried chicken or pizza ( once his diabetes is under control that is). He may be able to work a piece of fried chicken or a piece of pizza into a dinner once a week. Portion size and altering recipes helps me a lot. Like making extra thin crust pizza and limiting the cheese and adding extra vegetables plus a salad instead of things like fries or breadsticks. 

I also think your husband might be LADA ( type 1.5 adult onset type 1). I think he needs a c peptide test and antibody test. Especially since his dad was misdiagnosed. Seek a second opinion if you have to. Thats what I had to do. For me LADA made sense as I have multiple other autoimmune diseases. 

Best of luck to you both, dont be afraid to advocate for ruling out an alternative diagnosis!"
Rabidlamb,2022-05-20,3,"He's lucky to have you.

Now for the bad news, he's running 200+ &amp; he's already on Glic, this is not good. All the time his beta cells spend &gt;140mg/dl they are under stress &amp; will burn out further. On top of that he's taking a med that increases stress on the beta cells forcing them to release insulin that he's obviously not sensitive to.

There's only one route for him unless he alters course immediately. He needs to hit low carb hard. Embrace fasting, either 16:8, OMAD, 5:2 or even consider the hardcore Newcastle Diet. Something has to give or it's his eyes, kidneys, nerves that will pay the price."
chunktv,2022-05-20,2,"I appreciate the advice. We both know it's coming to a point... faster than we expected. His eyes started to go first, right after we found out about the diabetes... after he had a Double Hand Breaded Chicken Sandwich from Burger King. Great sandwich, but his BG shot up to 346 for the first time (this was a year ago). His doc is already worried about his kidneys and he's having some cognitive loss, memory and ability to type properly."
in_the_sheyd,2022-05-20,2,"The three Ps of hyperglycemia are polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia. In other words someone with hyperglycemia can expect to pee excessively, need an excessive amount of water to quench their thirst, and need an excessive amount of food to sate their hunger.

Hyperglycemia causes binge eating which makes hyperglycemia worse which makes the binging worse. The solution is to bring the blood glucose back under control with insulin."
pheregas,2022-05-20,2,"He really needs to get an antibody test for Type 1. Sooner than later.

If he has been misdiagnosed as Type 2, and hes coming out of his honeymoon period, BGs will continue to rise and hell continue to get hungrier as his body is just desperately trying to get fuel.

145 isnt a lot of weight. Generally T2s tend to be overweight as part of their insulin resistance. Is he losing weight?

Again, Id recommend getting him tested immediately."
manub22,2022-05-20,2,"Pre-diabetic here, I'm not on meds, but control my BG through diet control. Do not consume sugar &amp; not any form of sugar, and take ultra low carb &amp; protein rich diet. Plus, I also started running and tennis post diagnosis on daily basis.

Even after consuming glipizide or metformin tablets if his BG is going above 200/260, and fasting near 200, it's an alarming situation, and he should immediately stop binge eating sugary items and food items which are high in carbs. Even if he is munching low carb items, but binging too much will add extra carbs and ultimately more glucose/sugar to his body.

Excess glucose/sugar in the bloodstream can cause the kidneys to filter too much blood. Over time, this extra work puts more pressure on the **nephrons**, which often results in them losing their vital filtering ability, and ultimately **kidney failure** in the longer run (same for eyes), which you won't observe now... so this paragraph should be sounding alarming for him !!!

Please make sure to test BG in the morning with a **fasting** cycle of 10 hrs after the last dinner, it should be &lt; 100 (ideally, but not more than 120). And after taking breakfast or lunch take another BG reading (**postprandial**) after 2 hours, it should be &lt; 140 (ideally, but not more than 180).

If still he cannot stop binge-eating, then he should try **low carb** items which do not spike BG, like brown gram, chick peas, walnuts, almonds, eggs, yogurt, cottage cheese, cucumbers, green salad, etc.

If he craves for ice-creams, then you can try **yogurt + strawberries**, it really tastes like ice-cream but has no sugar.

Also, as he is T2D, then there are high chances he would be having elevated **cholesterol** and **triglyceride** levels. So make sure to avoid oil, fried and fatty food items too. Do not fall for products mentioned as poly/mono unsaturated fats, at this stage any kind of oil/fats is dangerous !!!

Is he involved in any **physical activity**, aerobics, sports, etc. Its very important for diabetic people and it really helps lower the BG levels.

T2D can be **reversed** like I reversed mine after a few months of diagnosis. Just that you need to follow a very careful diet and try to not depend on medications at all. Otherwise, after some time pancreas won't produce enough **insulin** and push one towards T1D."
EverPunk_Yetti,2022-05-20,2,"If I had to guess, it sounds like his blood sugar is spiked and hes eating so much because hes starving. Not in the sense that he isnt eating but in the sense that his organs arent getting enough fuel so they dump signals for food. He needs some type of insulin. Wether thats injection insulin or a pancreas stimulator would be up to an endocrinologist. What you are currently doing is not likely to be beneficial. Either get rid of the food stuffs, start using up that fuel via exercise, or get the chemicals to get that fuel into the organs. Because if he doesnt the. Things will get worse."
AutisticEngineer420,2022-05-20,2,"I would recommend actually going for high fat and not cutting that out. Basically fat is satiating, so it makes you stop eating once youve had enough. And generally fat has little to no impact on BS (it actually slows down sugar absorption so its good to pair fat with carbs when he does have carbs). Protein generally doesnt have much impact on BS either, but for some people it can cause a spike though of course less than carbs. But also protein is not as satiating as fat, and its hard to find snacks with only protein and not the other two."
RollerSkatingHoop,2022-05-02,2,what do you consider a low?
donuts_are_tasty,2022-05-02,5,Below 70mg/dL. Theyre usually in the 50s
barn9,2022-05-02,-1,"Get to your doctor is what you do.  Metformin is evil IMO, I didn't make it to the third day on that crap till it had me down.  Friend of mine ended up in the hospital for a couple weeks because of that shit."
donuts_are_tasty,2022-05-02,4,See I tried asking her too but she just said to keep taking it regularly and everything would solve itself. Its now been like 3 months and nothing has gotten better (except my insulin resistance) unless I stop taking it. :/
barn9,2022-05-02,-1,"Do some research on it, and maybe others will respond here, all I can say is that I would never take that crap again no matter what doctor told me it would be alright.  Neither would my friend, he had a close call because of it."
PhilliPARomneySR,2022-05-02,1,Jardiance is better.
jonathanlink,2022-05-02,5,"Arguable. It does different things from Metformin. It might be tolerated. Also women have a tendency if increased yeast infections. Some men, too."

juanimator,2022-05-02,1,"You didnt describe your diet, exercise, or other medicine you are taking. Most cases of hypoglycemia linked to metformin, which is very uncommon, are caused by eating too few calories, lots of exercise, or taking insulin or sulfonylurea while on metformin. 

Heres the reference:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6098632/

If your doctor is not an endocrinologist, Id find one to help work this out."
donuts_are_tasty,2022-05-02,1,"I didnt because weve already ruled that out. Turns out I eat more than enough carbs and calories and protein yet I still have consistent, but random lows"
jonathanlink,2022-05-02,1,"You still havent described your diet. I asked you twice in my thread and then you evade it here in this question. 

Your diet, activity and medication all play a role in your blood sugar levels. You need to understand how they interact. If youre eating 250g of carbs per day, you cannot, nor can your doctor, say you dont have reactive hypoglycemia. 

You and your doctor may have ruled it out, but likely in error."
ClayWheelGirl,2022-05-02,0,"hmmm. low? metformin is supposed to prevent lows.

what do you call low? do you have any symptoms when you are low?

wonder if another medication could be a better fit. wonder if ur dr is not changing coz insurance might not cover the pills. 

personally im on metformin n i have no complaints."
jonathanlink,2022-05-02,5,Metformin does not prevent lows. Its unusual for it to cause lows.
ClayWheelGirl,2022-05-02,1,thank you. you worded it better.
donuts_are_tasty,2022-05-02,1,"Metformin doesnt prevent lows

Under 70mg/dL. I have really bad hypo unawareness (confirmed by my doctor) so I dont really feel symptoms unless I get into the lower 40s"
Bookworm3616,2022-05-02,1,I take mine with meals. It typically helps. I also have extended release. Is it possible to lower dosage without getting completely off?
donuts_are_tasty,2022-05-02,2,"I also take mine with meals. Not able to lower dosage, Im already on the lowest dose"
Bookworm3616,2022-05-02,1,"Like 500 mg once a day? That was as low as my doctor could get me. 

Would extended release maybe help? 

I have gotten a few bad lows (once 40s driving across town because in search of control solution since Dexcom was low but not feeling), but not regularly like you."
donuts_are_tasty,2022-05-02,1,Yup. Already on extended release.
Bookworm3616,2022-05-02,2,"Yikes. Maybe try a new med? 

Mini Kind bars typically are good stabilizers. 8 carbs each for my pair of flavors, good balance of carbs and protein. I would try eating one around 80 if you are trending down. Hopefully, it'll give you a chance to not get into 40s like I noticed other comments of yours. Hypo unaware is scary even for me who's prediabetic. Dexcom legit saved my life I think at least twice."
donuts_are_tasty,2022-05-02,1,"Ill try to talk to my doctor about a new med. I figured I would ask here tho just to see what others thought. 

My go to is a bagel with peanut butter because carbs and protein. Ill try those bars tho bc they sound easier to keep in the car and stuff. Hypo unawareness is really scary. My libres have definitely saved me from some really bad ones."
Bookworm3616,2022-05-02,1,"I wish I had more then sympathy and understanding of your problems. The big bars I think average around 15 grams. The mini are nice few bites. Even nauseated I can eat them. 

Yeah, all I get is tired. High or low, or even just fine. Granted, good BS typically means I didn't sleep well the night before. Nothing like nap time at 190s."
AppointmentLatter302,2022-05-21,1,I can relate to this I am in same boat. BUT my metformin is not the extend one and it been regulating my sugar and keep it in normal range. Maybe ask your doctor for the none extend release
jonathanlink,2022-05-02,0,"So if youre in the 60s (a real low), eat something., close to meal time, eat a meal, otherwise a light snack.  If youre in the 50s, need to treat more aggressively with some quick acting carbs, test again 15 minutes later and repeat as necessary. 

My guess is that youre in the upper 60s, not used to that level and getting a sensation of feeling low. When my a1c was 10.4 and I started controlling it, Id get sensations of feeling low at 150."
donuts_are_tasty,2022-05-02,2,"I do get actual lows and I get them so often I have horrible hypo unawareness. I know how to treat lows. Im not asking how to treat lows, Im asking if theres a way to stop getting them on metformin."
jonathanlink,2022-05-02,2,Theres something called reactive hypoglycemia. Eat a lot of carbs and your pancreas over produces insulin. Metformin inhibits the liver from releasing glucose and there is the recipe for lows. What are your meals like?
donuts_are_tasty,2022-05-02,1,My doctor has already ruled that out since I get lows at random times of the day and not after meals. She said if I do have hypoglycemia is more likely fasting than reactive
jonathanlink,2022-05-02,2,Your doctor also told you that it would get better. Are your lows really random?  Completely unpredictable?
donuts_are_tasty,2022-05-02,1,"Yes they are. I use a libre sensor and if you look at the data its always at a random time, random time after meals, random time before meals, hell even sometimes during meals."
jonathanlink,2022-05-02,1,Your confirming some of these lows with a finger stick?
donuts_are_tasty,2022-05-02,1,"As Ive stated in my post, yes"
jonathanlink,2022-05-02,1,How low are you getting?
donuts_are_tasty,2022-05-02,1,As low as 30mg/dL

GoldPenalty7702,2022-05-20,10,Activity plays a role as well as insulin on board.
Forward-Bumblebee-18,2022-05-20,7,I was sitting down and didnt do any physical activity after eating it . what do you mean by the last part though ?
GoldPenalty7702,2022-05-20,3,Are you taking insulin?
Forward-Bumblebee-18,2022-05-20,4,nope one month ago my doctor said I dont need to take insulin anymore!!  only taking metaFormen
GoldPenalty7702,2022-05-20,12,So I guess your pancreas is working a little bit. Insulin on board means how much insulin you have taken and would still be active.
Forward-Bumblebee-18,2022-05-20,6,I actually have an appointment with them in three days . for the last month my sugar levels drop drastically in my last appointment they said it was my honeymoon faze i became a diabetic a year ago last month

Penny_from_heaven,2022-05-21,1,I go to 190 eating veggies lol .
Dangerous-Corner-989,2022-05-20,8,I have found that if I eat low carb the majority of the time I can have something like that every once in awhile and my blood sugar will do surprisingly well.  Its when I get on a binge of several days in a row of eating crap I shouldnt that my body doesnt tolerate the carbs.
ClayWheelGirl,2022-05-20,7,"i remember posting this same craziness last winter with ripe persimmons. one persimmon made me spike my sky high one day and the next day i had TWO great big ones and nothing!

the only way i understood was 1. guidance through here n 2. i journal a whole bunch of factors on paper and pen that helps me find answers.

so here are my questions for your guidance (not necessarily you have to answer them here). apply them to both events and see how things differ.

- did you sleep well that night
- how was your stress level that day (if like me you dont feel you are under stress look for emotional state or body pain)
- had you been regularly exercising up to that point for the past week or so
-what time of day did you eat (if the graph says so i dont know how to interpret it)? was it after dinner? what did u eat? did u start with a salad? followed by meat? did u eat the cake after taking a breather? did you drink lots of water? did you stay sitting after the cake or did you go for a walk or some activity?

my type 2 behaves a little differently. my diabetes is genetic. food is not stand alone for me. sleep, stress levels, regular exercise all affect how food impacts my body. when i eat, what order i eat affects my outcome.

 i need to do some resistance exercise but i dont. i mostly walk. but i do 2 kinds of walk. one leisurely- a stroll, slow smelling the flowers as i go along. i stop to say hi to the baby ducks. i may watch a soccer match for a bit. very casual. usually an hour at the park where i enjoy being amongst people having fun. it brings me great joy just to watch friends and families together. i do that either in the morning or early evening - sometimes both.

then i have the exercise walk. minimum 20 mins esp after a meal. this is a for business high speed walk. boring as hell. totally focused at walking 5 - 7 miles an hour speed. but better than a treadmill. 

it is necessary for me to stay pretty regimented because i show v. unpleasant symptoms v early at around 160. extreme fatigue esp around eyes (even family n friends can tell), blurry vision, brain fog, cranky n nausea. i can fall asleep right there n cannot continue a conversation."
DovBerele,2022-05-20,6,"&gt;my type 2 behaves a little differently. my diabetes is genetic. food is not stand alone for me. sleep, stress levels, regular exercise all affect how food impacts my body. when i eat, what order i eat affects my outcome.

this is true for everyone.  food is never the only thing that impact insulin sensitivity or blood sugar levels.  stress, sleep, illness, movement are always a factor. how big of a factor each is depends on the person."
Forward-Bumblebee-18,2022-05-21,1,ive actually been super stressed this whole week . I slept like a baby eight hours and for physical activity not much honestly probably not even the average amount of a normal person. for dinner I had steak spinach and mashed potatoes I had that around 8 oclock as you could see I was in the red around that time I had the cake about 30 to 40 minutes after I had my dinner . I thought the chart was too good to be true so I checked my finger multiple times and they were all around the same
Forward-Bumblebee-18,2022-05-21,1,also around that time I probably had two waters and were sitting down for the next three hours
00italianstallion00,2022-05-20,6,Meanwhile my blood sugar spiked by 100 just by waking up this morning

AeroNoob333,2022-05-20,2,Woohoo!! Dont you love it when that happens? :) Winning!!!
Forward-Bumblebee-18,2022-05-21,1,I do but at the same time I wish it wouldve gone high because I like knowing its at a pretty high level before I go to sleep =5 when my sugar drops I dont wake up in the middle of the night sweaty or anything so I like when its thighbefore I go to sleep
imjustmichael,2022-05-20,2,Was this cake perhaps sprinkled with cinnamon? :&gt;

GF eating is quite compatible with a diabetes friendly diet since either way you'll be avoiding bread and pasta."

BancyCoco,2022-05-17,2,What is the dawn effect? Newbie here
oniontomatocrouton,2022-05-17,3,Your liver dumps glucose into your bloodstream in the morning shortly before you wake up. Happens to every mammal.
BancyCoco,2022-05-17,1,I thought my blood sugar would be lower in the morning and I guess thats why its not? Aside from what Im eating.
nillanute4283,2022-05-18,1,"That's the intuitive guess. 

The dawn phenomenon occurs due to the release of hormones in the body. These can include things like growth hormone, cortisol, and glucagon. When levels of these hormones increase, your liver is stimulated to release glucose into your bloodstream. This typically occurs between the hours of 3:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m.

ClayWheelGirl,2022-05-17,1,"do u take your sugar then? what is the reading? if its in the 70s id eat something.

if its low sugar causing this the least of your concerns should be healthy. id quickly drink 2 oz of anything sweet - whatever you have on hand even if its regular soda, but even diluted apple juice would be better. then test again in half hour 1 hr. 

and im not sure what you mean no food for a long time. usually u dont eat for 12 to 14 hours overnight.

if u r on medication, and getting regular lows maybe your medication needs to be adjusted?"

breebop83,2022-04-30,2,"I have T1, seasonal allergies and asthma. I used to get sinusitis and/or bronchitis pretty much twice a year (beginning of spring and of fall). I take daily allergy meds (Claritin and Flonase) Zinc, D3 and I will take elderberry syrup when the pollen count is high. I also make sure to drink plenty of water.

Ive managed to only get sick once (not counting a bout of Covid in January) in the past 3 years or so. I have found that staying away from cold medicines that treat symptoms and using nasal irrigation and mucinex is the quickest way to get back to feeling ok. The biggest thing is to continue to take the mucinex and do the irrigation regularly for a few days after Im feeling better to avoid backsliding. 

Skipping the cold medicine usually means I feel crappier but only for about a week. When I was taking cold medicine it would sometimes take weeks to actually feel better 

Taking cold medicine around the clock really seems to prolong things and I just start feeling crappy again when I stop taking them. So I try to avoid that. The mucinex does have cough suppressant but it also has an expectorant that breaks up the mucus so you can (for lack of a better) hack it up and get it out of your lungs."

Before diagnosis, I was already counting my macros and working out regularly: lifting weights 5-6x a week and walking 2-6 miles a day so my insulin sensitivity was already amazing.

You cant forget your mental health in this. It gets stressful focusing and putting a time constraint for how fast you want to lose the weight. But you have to consider the fact that you most of all matter in this. This is a lifestyle change because you have to consistently and constantly focus on it. I mean your overall health. When you are able to get it down youll also realize its a big breath of relief but also a big source of stress being relieved off of you. Its why its important to also process trauma that could have led to becoming a diabetic.

I come from a culture that likes to body shame (even if you're at a normal weight, those Euro-centric beauty standards in the Philippines) and didn't talk about mental and physical health. My Mum and Dad didn't talk about our family's medical history in detail. My Dad said he's known about his T2D, but was super stubborn in not wanting to consider medication as well as any diet changes  - he thought he could control it with only exercise. It was only a few years ago his GP put him on metformin for better control and my Dad has accepted that he'll be on it long term. Thankfully, the relatives I have the live with diabetes have lived a long life (90's) without any serious complications. When I got diagnosed, had to do a lot of unpacking in regards to that - and it is a relief seeing all the changes and that source of stress being taken off. People forget these lifestyle changes take time to do, and more time to see the effects. It wasn't until now I've had friends point out how happier I am as well as the weight loss."

Sepulchara,2022-05-24,1,"Under 6 with same process. Also lost 80 labs. Low carb time restricted eating, walking, WIN!"
baffojoy,2022-05-25,1,"I found setting a daily carb limit and keeping track of it helped. If you're planning to lose weight, I found apps like LoseIt gave you a weight loss plan depending how much you want to lose, they don't recommend trying to lose more than half a kilo a week. I initially started on 1000mg of metformin - that was too much in terms of side effects, then it was halved to 500mg. Last doctors visit, I have borderline low sugar (even with the advice that it was okay to be a bit more flexible with my 150g daily limit and have a bit more, haha) and with the recent finger prick, endocrinologist made the decision to halve my dosage at 250mg. I only have to take the metformin once a day. My last A1C was 7.2 in January (after a month of diagnosis), and I don't know when my endocrinologist will schedule the next one. 

However, I wasn't too overweight (63kgs, 5'2 height) when I got diagnosed as I was already working on it pre diagnosis. I'm currently at 57kgs and the weight loss seems to have stabilized that my endocrinologist is happy for me to maintain my current weight.

As for fitness, my endocrinologist recommended me to at least walk 7000 steps daily - I tend to average about 12k daily, usually getting these steps in my commute to work (take the stairs for some intensity, get off at the previous train station and walk etc).

The thing with T2, your pancreas might be half-dead so your body might just need extra help by needing to take insulin along with any other medication in order to have better control. You can do you best in trying to reach that goal but don't beat yourself up if your body needs the extra help. Also, give it time for the lifestyle changes to work - it's not instant."

I notoriously didn't test enough and didn't think it was an issue because I was still always taking my insulin. Prebolusing, making sure my ratios are/were correct, and not being afraid of insulin as well. I used to take insulin and start eating for like 7 years until I got back into prebolusing recently. Since returning to the office I'm not as good about it as i used to be, but still better than nothing. I also was going through resistance and general ratio changes and my endo didn't help me, so I was taking like 10u every hour every time my blood sugar was high because it was the only thing that was working. Turns out, all my ratios needed changing and I got put in metformin. But without that, I was still in such a ""these are my numbers, this should work!"" mindset it felt like punching a wall. So I started just taking more and seeing if that would help. I think that's the only thing that kept my a1c manageable before I was able to keep it down. 

I didn't make any diet changes and was actually vegetarian at the time, so eating more carbs, plant protein, and fiber."

The average aspartame sodas have about 50-90mg of aspartame per can. So lets average that to 70mg of aspartame per can.

So if you weigh 70kg. 70x35 = 2450mg limit of aspartame per day

2450 / 70 (1 can) = 35 cans

So unless you're downing 35 cans a day, it shouldn't be a concern ;)"
jonathanlink,2022-05-17,12,Aspartame in moderation is fine. Its been well studied and the cancer and neurological concerns are in rats and with mega doses.

Comedian-Vast,2022-05-17,4,"If I remember correctly, the study involved injecting the rats with the equivalent of 20 cans of soda.

My parents have been drinking 4 to 5 (sometimes more) diet cokes for the passed 40 years and the only medical problems they've had are problems that were expected due to parents or other family members having.

I'm not saying it isn't bad for you but it's been well studied and the cancer connection is bullshit."

WoefulHC,2022-05-17,6,"If by ""two zero sugar sodas a day"" you mean 2 12 oz cans you are super far from the levels of sweetener that are ""of concern"". The levels of concern translate into the something like several thousand liters per day for an adult human.

DarkestEmber,2022-05-17,6,"Unless you're specifically allergic to aspartame (or rather, what aspartame breaks down into) then there isn't really any worries unless you're specifically consuming gallons of the stuff every day.

A Times reporter visited the country and one of the points he made over and over again was how beautiful the women were.

He described them as being slender and graceful with dark hair and large, dark eyes.

Finally, at the end of the article, he asked one of the women why she thought they were all so lovely.

I have been checking my blood sugar 4 times a day( it sucks) but hopefully if the insulin helps I will take that, it is still manageable. I just need to find a diet which I can stick to for a long time, not just for a few weeks and then back to eating whatever I want.

I hope it works out for you as well, and if I can give any reassurance it's that the insulin pen injection hardly hurts at all, thank God for that."

Last month I paid out of pocket for an extra A1C test to make sure I was seeing progress, because my anxiety was going crazy and I was starting to feel panicky.

slashedpotatoe,2022-05-20,1,"There's a keto doctor on YouTube, Ken Berry, who teaches keto to put diabetes in remission.

I did not believe him, tried it anyway, and have had completely normal sugars for 2 months now. And I feel amazing. 

Hes not selling anything, there's nothing to buy. Its literally just nutrition information."
hambone1,2022-05-20,2,"Thank you for this info!

Do you do do a modified keto diet or is it a real, 20g of carbs a day, keto diet?"
slashedpotatoe,2022-05-20,1,"Its real, below 20 carbs a day info. Seriously check him out on YouTube. 

I eat bacon and eggs each morning. A salad for lunch, and a meat and a veggie for dinner. I drink water and coffee. I'm not hungry anymore at all (that took about 50 days to happen). The first 2 weeks were rough. Buy tons of keto snacks for the beginning, when you're breaking the actual sugar addiction, because getting hungry will trigger insane cravings, so eat like nonstop the first 2 weeks. 

Once the weight starts melting off and energy explodes, it gets pretty easy to stay on plan. 

I think the biggest thing though is how good I feel. I was sooo tired all the time, and just felt awful. Now I have much more energy and my sex drive has become like puberty level. 

I was concerned about the high fat of the diet, but after 3 weeks I was able to stop my blood pressure meds, soooo.... I'm trusting the process. We will see how my cholesterol is at the next labs."

Make sure you get to the airport 30 minutes - 1 hour early. It is worth it to avoid feeling rushed.

Run-And_Gun,2022-05-20,3,"&gt;Anyone have any luck not telling airport security about your diabetes and letting your pump supplies goes through security? Will Dexcom really stop working if I go through the x-ray thing with it on? Is it fine to disconnect from my pump and send it with the rest of my belongings?  
I hate getting pat down. Last time I was asked to throw my insulin away...

Are you flying in the US?

Literally the closest thing Ive ever said to Im diabetic at airport security, is when one of the TSA agents inevitably points and says something about taking my cell phone off and I simply say, Its an insulin pump.  Thats it.  Nothing else is ever said, beyond them saying they have to do the explosives swab after I go through the scanner.

Ive been a T1 for 36 years and flying for business since the late 90s.  Also on a pump since 2008 and Dex since 2015.  I have literally never taken my pump off, nor will I, to go through security.  The body scanners and metal detectors will not hurt your CGM, your pump or the insulin in it.  I also have all of my pump supplies and insulin in my backpack that I carry.  It all goes through the x-ray machine and Ive never said a word or had anything said about my supplies in there(its not going to hurt your insulin or spare CGM, either).

By my personal experiences flying regularly for almost 25 years, I find it hard to believe TSA asked you to throw away your insulin(was it TSA or were you somewhere other than the US?)."

friendless2,2022-05-20,1,"Which airport.  I want to go through it just to raise hell with these idiots.

I have been traveling with T1 supplies for 23 years, in the US and abroad.  

Originally I was a normal traveler, so insulin in a baggie, in the bin with the shoes.  Supplies in my carry on going though the normal x-ray, lunch bag with reusable ice pack also in the bin which gets hand checked to verify it is solid.

Now I use TSA-Pre.  In use insulin stays in my kit (I call it my pancreas).  Future insulin is in my lunch bag with the reusable ice pack, which gets hand checked to verify it is solid.  Shoes stay on.

When I used a CGM, I asked for a pat down.  Now I don't have to do that.  

There is no need for a doctor's note, as they don't have time to read it or verify it is true.

I don't get hassled for any of it.  I got more hassle in China for disorganized power cables than my ice pack.  I have an organizer for the cables now.

I really want to try this airport out.  I'll skip TSA-Pre just to have a heated argument with these people and get supervisors involved, see how far they are going to take it."

Spitfiresoul698,2022-05-20,1,"never had many problems.   


I always put all my supplies in a ziplock (clear) bag and show them the medical declaration form from my doctor.   
I have never ever witnessed a security agent take even time to read the declaration or inspect the items in the clear bag match what is on the declaration. (closest I ever got was one in turkey who looked at the paper for 5 seconds instead of the usual glance and nod)  


(I do use pens so no pump attached to me)

&amp;#x200B;

I currently do have the freestyle libre sensors for glucose monitoring. only issue I ever had was with those.   
the sensors can't go through the scanner there (not sure what happens if they do), you have to take spare sensors you have with you through the metal detector and not leave them in your bag on the conveyor.

In Dubai that gave some issue. had to show the sensor, explain what it did, open the packaging(box), etc.   
no pat down or anything. just lost a good 15 minutes trying to explain this to a security who only spoke broken English."
TheTealBandit,2022-05-20,1,Worn sensors can go through metal detectors but not 360° scanners. Spares should not go through the x-ray. Insulin is allowed as long as you take it out and put it in a clear plastic bag
Run-And_Gun,2022-05-20,2,"&gt;but not 360° scanners

That may be the company line, but in seven years, Ive never had anything happen to one of my Dex sensors or Tx."
TheTealBandit,2022-05-20,1,Well that may be the case but it is not sufficiently tested and there will usually be a metal detector nearby
Ok-Papaya6653,2022-05-20,1,"I have just returned from a trip abroad by air. First flying experience in 4 years I always carry a letter outlining my diabetes requirements for travel. I use a Omnipod Dash pump &amp; Dexcom GCM. For the 1st time I did not say anything to the security staff. I put my insulin &amp; a spare insulin pen in a transparent plastic bag together with other liquid/gel stuff, like toothpaste, lipstick etc which I was taking in my carry-on . For the first time ever, and I used to travel about 3 times a year, there was no problem. Last time I was marched off to a private room to have pod &amp; cgm checked. Decided now best to say nothing but have the letter just in case"
melancholalia,2022-05-20,1,"do you have TSA pre check? if not, i HIGHLY recommend  it makes airport security just generally so much easier, and you only have to go thru the metal detector (as opposed to the body scan thing).  in that case, you only really need to hand them your pump and any spare dexcom sensors and then go through the metal detector. theyll do the normal explosive swab on your stuff and then send you on your merry way.

they shouldnt be going through all your stuff even if you have to opt out of the body scan for a pat down. def dont try to pop off your transmitter though."
DriftingGator,2022-05-24,10,"It took me months of trial and error to figure out how to combat the spike for my home brewed coffee. Finally figured out about how many carbs worth of insulin is needed to combat the spike based on how much insulin was effective in preventing it, now I take insulin for that number of carbs before I take the first glorious sip of my personality activator and the only time I really spike anyway is if my blood sugar is already elevated, but even then the spike is tiny compared to what it used to be. 

Now coffee from a shop is a completely different story and I just give up before I start on that one honestly. Accept the spike and realize that I will feel exactly none of the caffeine benefits due to the rapid spike. But damn it, it tastes good so its worth it (not really, I feel like trash after)."

DriftingGator,2022-05-25,2,I add a splash each of almond milk and carbless flavoring. But even black coffee does me dirty so I figured why drink something that tastes gross and makes me spike when I could drink something that tastes better and makes me spike to the same degree?

purplepigeon91,2022-05-24,8,"Extra insulin. Also, check the labels for whatever you put in your coffee. The ""sugar free"" creamer I used to use had corn syrup as the second ingredient. I starting using almond milk instead and the spike is nowhere near as bad.

yrioux,2022-05-24,1,"one month ago, I was on MDI with dexcom and xdrip. In xDrip you can set up the CI ratio, ISF, and calculate your insulin like you can do with a pump.  I have really good results with this setup.

choodudetoo,2022-05-24,1,"As an experiment, can you try single pasteurized heavy cream instead of the steam milk?  You probably won't need much to get close on the taste.

Where I live, the single pasteurized heavy cream does not have the carrageenan and other gums that definitely taste bad and are added to all the ultra pasteurized cream like objects in my local stores.

My partner is a Type 2 and we gave up on milk ages ago.

dv_,2022-05-25,2,"This is actually a tricky topic, because one can easily conflate multiple phenomena. Many people habitually drink their morning coffee, but there are several bodily processes that rise the BG in the morning. If one drinks coffee every morning, one can easily misattribute the BG rise to the coffee. 

Furthermore, in some individuals, large amounts of caffeine really does seem to induce a stress response, especially those who aren't used to such coffeine levels, and stress responses can lead to serious amounts of cortisol and adrenaline being secreted, which stimulate the liver to dump glucose in the blood.

Finally, many CDEs incorrectly downplay the influence of milk on the BG. Milk actually can raise the BG substantially and rather rapidly, depending on how much lactase the person produces. Large amounts of lactase lead to rapid cleaving of lactose into galactose and glucose, in turn causing a rapid BG increase. Conversely, those with reduced lactase production experience less of a BG increase (but are more likely to have gastric issues due to insufficient lactose breakdown)."

kevinut27,2022-05-23,3,"I have been in your place, society tells us we must love our parents and relatives but that's because they don't have toxic and harmful parents and relatives. I have felt bad because of this, telling friends my situation and then they telling me I am wrong etc, but they don't have to deal with this kind of toxic people at home. And there is no better feeling than getting rid of toxic people from your life, either they are your parents or not.  


So my advice is they can got to hell, they are nobody to tell you nothing about your diabetes and how you to threat it, even more if they only contact you to tell you are no taking enough care of your diabetes, they are not diabetics to have an opinion on how hard is to keep the levels in range, they think is so easy and it is not. Same with the doctors, they get mad like if you are not trying to take proper care.

Gryphynmama,2022-05-23,0,"After reading the other comments here I feel like what Im about to say will be very unpopular but here goes&

A couple thoughts: parenting never, ever ends. There is no date when you wash your hands of your kids and say yep, Im all done now 

Sometimes parents make terrible choices on how they express their fear and frustration with the circumstances of this disease. That doesnt necessarily make them toxic or deserving of being cut out of your life, it does mean, that just like you theyve never been in exactly this position and are trying to figure it out so they need some grace too.

They definitely do use the follow feature to keep tabs on you and your blood sugar - thats literally the whole point of it. It also may offer them some reassurance that youre doing ok and that they can let go a little in checking in with you in other ways. They may be under the impression you need/want that.

How is your management lately? Have there been particularly scary moments recently? Dont get me wrong thats ultimately your decision too, but it may be where some of the (overly) drastic threats come from& I

If youre still financially dependent on your parents: on their auto insurance policy, medical insurance policy, have a room in their home, education expenses, other expenses paid etc, it may be that they dont see you as a fully actualized adult because you arent yet. I know thats hard to hear but age isnt what makes you an adult, its behaviors.  

What you see as a bare minimum of contact may be them trying to let you fly a little on your own. Id also ask, do you reach out to your parents and offer to meet up for coffee or a movie or in some other way spend time together or do you wait for them? 

I do hope you find peace and I can understand that you need to be less connected to your phone all the time, but if you want a deeper relationship with your folks thats unrelated to diabetes, Im not sure that disconnecting is the way to go."
anonaf999,2022-05-23,1,"My parents neglected me my entire childhood, my mom pays my car insurance because she feels bad for the abuse I went through. I am well managed, and I do live on my own and support myself in all other ways.

jeopardy_themesong,2022-05-23,1,"Threatening to call the police for a wellness for disabling their access to the sensor (ie, not an emergency) is pretty toxic in my book. That can be highly disruptive especially if the cops perform said check at OPs work or school."
18randomcharacters,2022-04-29,6,"Sometimes, you just have to science the shit out of it. 

Note: Write down all your observations and changes. This is going to be a multi-day process, and it's important to keep notes to keep things straight.

  
Pick a time of day, and work on stabilizing THAT part. Night time is probably easiest since it's often the most consistent part of our day.  


Fast before bed for 4 hours or more.  Ideally when you go to sleep your BG should be flat, not trending up or down. Then see what it does. 

If bg went up overnight, increase night time basal by 10%. If it went down, reduce 10%. Repeat experiment until your night trends are fairly flat.

Next, breakfast. Wait to eat until bg is stable. Eat a very well known amount of carbs. Like 1 packet of instant oatmeal, or use a scale to measure a specific amount of cereal or something. Tell your pump you had that many grams (pre-bolus). If you go high or low, adjust your carb ratio a little for that time of day, and repeat experiment the next day.   


Do the same for lunch, and dinner, etc.   


Mid-day basal is a little trickier. I tend to look at my day-over-day statistics and if I see a consistent high trend at a given time (say, 2-5pm), I increase basal 10%. Maybe I should be adjusting my bolus instead, I dunno.

Everything is wrong, I cant figure anything out on my own, and my endocrinologist can only do so much: I feel like I need another T1 to help me. At this rate Ill die soon enough from over correcting a high or losing too much weight. Someone please message me and help me"
mickledapickle,2022-04-29,6,"Hey - first, this really sucks I'm so sorry it's been so crazy the last few weeks.

If I were you, I'd start to eat a really consistent diet over the next week and see the results i.e. make sure you're eating similar foods in similar quantities and most importantly, at the same time each day. Then slowly introduce other foods to see how your BG reacts and go from there.

I've had periods of time where I've had the dawn effect more than others,  mostly due to irregularities in exercise, weight, or sleep. Like I said, I'd try to be as consistent as possible for  a week and kind of reset everything.

Given the weight loss, I'm a bit surprised your BG is going higher than normal instead of the other way. That throws a bit of a wrench in how I'd tackle this, but again I'd try to control the diet / sleep / exercise to see if it's not something outside of the food you're eating that is impacting you so significantly.

Edit - And I'd try a dynamic basal over different time periods to see if you can't control your BG with that. I have like 8 different rates throughout the day / night."
toproflcopter,2022-04-29,2,"I had the same idea about eating a consistent diet. Within the next few days, Im going to basically eat the same exact thing every day and figure out where Im going wrong. If I cant figure it out, Im about a breath away from switching to an entirely soy lent diet so I just give roughly the same amount of insulin each time.

Yeah the thing is Im supposed to eat around 2000 calories a day (Im a 20 year old male). The problem is that Id start my morning high (from either an incorrect basal or dawn effect, maybe both) and then have to eat breakfast at 180. You know that whenever you eat, youll spike at least somewhat, so Id spike to 250+ and then have to bring myself back down with corrections. The problem is that if I wasnt coming down due to, say Insulin Resistance, bad pod, or high fat/protein meals, I would still have to eat while high which isnt really a good idea. However, its either eat high or dont eat until you come down: Thus the weight loss."
mickledapickle,2022-04-29,1,"Mm gotcha, yeah I feel the struggle. FWIW I've been on a bulk / cut cycle for the last year and have had to make some pretty significant adjustments to basal / bolus rates as my weight has fluctuated - even if not by a huge margin - e.g. I've lost 15 lbs (from 200) over the last month and my basal rate has dropped \~20%. Basal rate can definitely make a huge impact on BG - arguably more than bolus for me.

I think I'd stick with a consistent diet and go from there. If it gets tough, trying something that keeps insulin intake consistent would probably be a good option like you said - with the possibility of introducing other foods as you get the BG back under control.

If I were you, I may be more aggressive with bolusing given the spikes you've seen in  BG. I've always found it is easier to bring a low BG up than it is to bring a high BG down (though the side effects aren't too fun that way)."
Interesting-Walrus23,2022-04-29,2,"What basal do you take? How many units? How do you bolus meals, carb ratio? What kind of food are you eating?"

I generally prebolus 15 minutes before eating. Ive been trying to incorporate boluses for fat and protein otherwise I go super high later on, but its been pretty rough. 

Carb Ratio is currently 16, Correction Factor is roughly 65.

Food that I eat is kinda all over the place, but for dinners I consistently have meat/bread/some vegetables or cheese."

yesitsmenotyou,2022-04-30,1,"I think any time there is a big unexplained change - thats a good time to get a checkup and find out if there is a why that you need to know, some underlying cause.  More likely that its just diabetes being an asshole, but good to cover your bases. 

Also, you could figure this out totally on your own or without calling a CDE, but sometimes its really nice to get some help too and maybe learn a new trick or two. Have you listened to the Juicebox Podcast? Lots of great stuff in the Pro Tips. 

But blah blah, back to your graph. How much of those highs and lows are food/bolus related? You said youre going high at night&are the lows all during the day? 

Have you ever done basal testing?"
toproflcopter,2022-04-30,1,"I was at my endo last week and she gave the typical advice (which isnt useless) but the problem is that after having a life threatening situation due to T1D Ive basically regressed into a terrified kid that doesnt know how to handle the disease. I dont trust my intuition anymore, leading to things like under corrections and bad meal boluses.

Most of the highs are from meals. I started pre bolusing by 15 minutes but Im still spiking a bit higher than Id like. Worse, some of these meals are high fat/protein so once Im high its a lot harder to come down. In the past, Id usually just give a bunch of reactive boluses to stop myself from going up but Im scared to do so now (and its probably not great practice anyway). 

The lows are usually in response to the highs: I finally go down after hours of being high.

Thanks for the help man"
yesitsmenotyou,2022-04-30,1,"It is hard to come back after a bad low and not have some insulin fear. I dont have t1 but my daughter does, and Ive been through that from the caregiver side of things. Not quite the same thing, but I get it. 

I think the other advice to work on dialing your basal back in is the best place to start, and getting some boringly consistent meals to get your bolus ratios settled out. But doing it with the mental piece of it all hanging over you can make it feel all that much more overwhelming, for sure. I would definitely consider meeting with a cde just to get some detailed feedback on the numbers game part of it just for that reason&its a lot to shoulder alone, especially after a traumatic experience. IMO the mental layers should get regular attention and maintenance just like the physical parts, especially considering how interdependent they are."

toproflcopter,2022-04-29,3,"Ive been trying to figure out my basal for 2 weeks and Im exhausted.

I found that .65/.70 generally works well to keep me flat, but I rise out of nowhere around 6-7am until midday (you can see it in the graph I posted). This is weird because Ive really never had the dawn effect so Im not entirely sure how to deal with it.

Just today I added a new profile from 4AM-12PM where Ill have basal as .8. I hope itll help keep me flat rather than bring me up from 130-230 like it did last night."
drugihparrukava,2022-04-29,3,"I had weeks of experimenting for dawn phenomenon. Had a second profile where i went from .55 to .95 just for an hour before dawn, then down to .6 then changed again for feet on floor. It worked great until it didn't now I'm changing that again ;) it's entirely frustrating how things work great and then it's plain wrong. Now I do an extended bolus, 0% for bedtime and add 100% of whatever bolus I choose for 3:30am and worked like a charm.

smiledoc77,2022-04-30,1,"1. Do  basal testing by not eating ANYTHING for one day to start regulating your basal. You will have to repeat this 2-3 times to get your basal properly regulated. Your objective is to be at ~100 mg/dl for 24 hours.

2. After basal is regulated LEAVE IT ALONE!

3. Start eating your preferred diet (mine is steak and salad, and donuts snd cookies). Make sure you log EVERYTHING, I mean EVERYTHING!  Bolus, carbs, exercise, sleep, emotional state, all time stamped. Do this for a couple of months

4. By this time you should start to understand how different foods and activities effect you and the bolus amounts you need to maintain a reasonable and stable blood glucose.

5. The intensive part of this will take 2-3 months, but realize you have a lifetime to live and thrive with this disease. And realize that you will never stop learning!

Be thankful you have a CGM and analog insulins to do this. I did it with urine tests (home glucose meters were still about 8 years away)  and R &amp; NPH insulin (analogs were about 10 years away).  But it was doable.

GOOD LUCK!"
No_Constant_4056,2022-04-30,1,"seems your basal insulin is not aligned with your current need and sometimes you bolus too much.

Please correct your BG only every 2 hours with bolus and if its still rising, then it means your basal insulin dosage is incorrect."
toproflcopter,2022-04-30,2,"I agree. 

My basal actually works ok during the early hours of the night, but you can see that around 6am it starts to climb consistently; Dawn effect maybe. Im trying an increase of .7 to .8 from 5AM-12PM tonight, hopefully it does a better job of controlling it. 

As for boluses, I think I actually bolus too little initially and then give reactive boluses based on its tuition as I climb. It usually just causes a low and more problems."

T2d9953,2022-04-30,1,"Trial and error, if you go lower than you want before your meal, you can always have 5 - 10 g of carbs before your meal (5-10 grapes, a couple ounces of juice, etc). I find that if I am not headed down slightly at the start of the meal, it is easy for the food to overtake the insulin and shoot up. You can also split your bolus dose.

ORGrown,2022-05-26,1,"For straight black coffee, I would suggest trying something other than starbucks. Their coffee is specifically roasted to a level where the coffee flavor will cut through tons of milk and sugar. That means that when you drink it as straight black coffee though, it's super burnt and overwhelming. Some roasters prep their coffee in a way that is specifically meant for drinking black. You'd be surprised at how good (not bitter, flavorful, almost sweet even!) plain black coffee can be if it's done well. I'd suggest trying to find a coffee shop that has ""pourover"" coffee as an option. Even better if they roast their own beans. Talk to the baristas and tell them that you're new to that style of coffee, and they can point you towards something good. I'd stay away from anything labeled as ""naturally processed"" for now. Washed process will have more of a traditional coffee taste. Naturals are good, but pretty funky, and don't necessarily taste like coffee the way you typically think about it."

Some of my students literally have no control over the way they act, but they still need to understand that their actions have an effect on others and that effect is their responsibility. 

Now, back to diabetes in particular. Uncontrolled diabetes can affect aggression and mood. When I'm low I act drunk and when I am high I get irritable. I am aware of this and work to control my glucose as a result. But it would never make me abusive - it affects inhibitions, it doesn't change your base personality.

I believe a lot of us in the disabled world have been fed two conflicting narratives for most of our lives. We are told ""if you try hard and put your mind to it, you can achieve anything!"" This sets us up for disappointment since nobody can actually do anything they set their mind to - I will never be a world class target shooter, my hands shake and my eyesight isn't good enough. Doesn't mean I can't enjoy shooting. The second thing we are told is that our disabilities limit us, define us, and will always make us less valuable to the world.

Your boyfriend (or more accurately, man-child) is bang out of order. Yes lows can make us a bit on edge and even aggressive, and we don't mean to be that way. But him ignoring lows and letting himself get into that state? That is all on him. That is a choice that he has made when he knows the repercussions of those choices, he just doesn't give a shit who has to pay for those repercussions.

What he said in regards to your daughters cries is some psycho shit for real. This has nothing to do with him being diabetic, and everything to do with him clearly having unresolved issues with anger. I would also question whether he may even be narcissistic, as they do really hate anyone but themselves receiving attention. That would include your child. The comment he made was petty at best and very much screams 'me, me, me!'. I would consider how much you want him around your child when it's entirely possible that if he is a narcissist, he will hold resentment against your child due to it."
jenana__,2022-05-05,5,"It feels like a lot of you tell makes me think that there's a bit of room for improvement. Sure there's something like a diabetes card (in the way: it's there; I don't mean that it should be there or it's good). In this case I have the feeling that it means for him that he can get away with whatever behaviour/issue he wants.

To isolate a few thoughts:    
It seems like he can get away with a lot. Obviously not without drama, but he gets away with it regardless. I would say I see a lot of orange and red flags. Partner A playing video games while partner B takes care of the house (and child is playing) -&gt; NO.     
You being *responsible* for his lows in any way -&gt; NO. Your task is to make diner/lunch at noon. If he wants a snack or want his food 5 minutes earlier or want extra's -&gt; HIS responsibility.     
Another red flag -&gt; if he doesn't get it the way he wants (food, lows, his diabetes, the reaction of the children) HE has to deal with it, without passing it on to make it somebody else's responsibility. It's really a red flag (in any relationship, at least it is for me) that your partner getting upset shouldn't mean the fight is about to start or you have to get upset too. That's wrong and toxic.

By the way, as a dad and a dedicated partner, it's up to him to keep his cool instead of acting like this (while playing videogames). It's up to him to stay enjoyable and keep the peace too. Having a low or not getting it his way is no excuse."

You aren't compatible and your boyfriend is weaponizing his diabetes. His diabetes is his to manage. It's not anyone elses problem or responsibility. My partner has mental health issues that sometimes impact on the way he behaves. He knows that there are some boundaries he can't cross and if he does, there are consequences. I understand that sometimes he's hurting but that doesn't give him the right to hurt the people around him. I will support him and help him but I won't accept disrespect or abuse. His condition does not give him the right to hurt me. I manage my diabetes and he helps me with some things. I can get a little snappy when I'm low because there isn't enough sugar going to my brain but screaming at someone is not acceptable.

TheJesusSixSixSix,2022-05-05,1,"22y male 

You remind me of my girlfriend in how you describe yourself. Ive only been recently diagnosed and at my worst moments I may be snippy or lethargic but I dont sit on my throne farting and playing video games demanding her to manage my health for me. That is unfair, damaging, and can cause issues if not addressed meaningfully. Make him a nice meal, have him sit down and focus on you good mood and all - confront his ass! If confrontation is not a strong suit of yours, it is still such an important thing to handle for the benefit of your own mental health. Do it. Often times the anxiety and stressed causes by an issue is far greater than the confrontation. If it really goes sour, you can decide how to proceed from there but if he turns the whole conversation about his diabetes when you are trying to speak on character may be red flag. I would think about what my child might realize from his habits and use that to weigh in decisions about the future. Think about your relationship. Do you carry the emotional and physical load? If so then address that, explain how you feel like. There should be no shame in taking time away from a relationship (even if its just 1 or 2 days every two weeks) to do things that make you happy, successful, or fulfilled. 

Again Im a Youngblood and this turned into relationship advice but-

 tl;dr diabetes does not give him a pass in this case, its imperative to address your thoughts about it to him."
Plague_Evockation,2022-05-05,1,"T1D, 30 y/o and was diagnosed 17 years ago. Your boyfriend is an immature and irresponsible person who needs to improve himself. You're doing nothing wrong, and accepting his poor behavior and mistreatment of your daughter due to ""low blood sugar"" will only futher enable him.

I've spent years working in kitchens with no breaks or time to eat (ironic, huh?) and managed the lows that came with it just fine without lashing out at others.

Not trying to give relationship advice, but I think it would be best to step back from this relationship. A 36 y/o man who blames his poor behavior on diabetes and takes it out on your daughter is a recipe for absolute disaster."
buzzybody21,2022-05-05,1,"Nope. Diabetes does not give you cart blanche to be an asshole to people for absolutely no reason.

Intelligent_Rain4890,2022-05-05,1,"I am a Type 1 diabetic of 20 years. My husband and I have been together for something like 12 of them. I will admit that when I go low I can get snippy. It may even cause me to bring up grievances that happened at another time that havent been addressed yet. But I do not use it as an excuse to berate him or our child, I do not expect him to take care of my condition for me either. There are times I have to ask him to get something for me if its low enough to make walking hard or dangerous. But I ask for his help. I do not demand or yell at him for it. And if I do end up being extra grumpy or say something hurtful I apologize for my behavior and work on not letting it happen again. You sound... Trapped in a relationship that doesn't make you happy. And from your descriptions he treats you more like a servant and your daughter as someone who is an annoyance. And his behavior is narcissistic and abusive towards you and your daughter. If the relationship is something you wish to salvage I suggest both couples therapy and individual therapy for the both of you. But once you get to the end of your rope and cant see happiness anymore no matter what, you wouldnt be the asshole for putting you and your child first and walking away."
Chel061289,2022-05-05,1,I've been Type 1 for 21 years and i have a really hard time recognizing when I'm low(I'm on Dexcom now and it's helped so much). I tend to get combative as hell when I go low and in a way black out from it because I have zero memory of it and it sucks knowing I was mean and not knowing what I said or did. What your boyfriend is doing is the opposite he is fully aware of what he is doing and is just refusing to fix HIS problem. You've tried helping where you can with him but honestly he sounds toxic for you and your daughter. He needs to get his shit together and learn to do shit on his own because he clearly made it this long in life so he can keep himself alive. You are already a mother to a young girl you shouldn't be a mother to a grown ass man if he wants that he should move home.

I'm sure he is used to his parents grabbing snacks for when he was low. It is hard to getting out of that habit. But he still shouldn't be given a free pass for yelling at you.

Wonder_Frau,2022-04-26,9,"For me the metformin has been really helpful in bringing down my levels. With the help of metformin and some dietary  and lifestyle changes I'm no longer hovering around 17.5 mmol/l (roughly 315 mg/dl) in a relatively short time frame.

Taking medication isn't a failure, in case you feel some of that stigmatization. We would not look at someone with a broken arm having a cast as such, we shouldn't look at ourselves that way either.

While eating certainly is more boring at the moment, it is getting easier. 

I'm tracking how different foods are affecting me now with my meds, and those that make me go back up to 11 (198), 12 (216) or 13 (234) I either kick to the curb or experiment with preparation, ingredient substitution, or portion size to see if they can still fit in or not.

It certainly is a lot all at once and it can feel overwhelming especially if you are told ""hey you're diabetic, take X amount of this medication, I woitell you at all how it works, and I'll see you in a month"" without any other information.

We just got to keep at it, take our meds, eat as best we can, move as much as we can. That is my philosophy of the day."

InspectorLD,2022-04-26,5,"Your numbers aren't too bad. Ask your doctor next time for diet recommendations/resources. Food management is the most important thing you can do to keep the disease at bay. Exercise (even as small as a brief walk) can help your body process fats and insulin better over the long run.

Leaning on a more vegetable-based diet helps. Add greens into your pre-existing meals to start. This is a lot at once I know. Your changes can be small and gradual as you continue to learn more overtime. 

Some fruits are better than others. I still use fruit in my diet. Strawberries, blueberries, and half an apple are better for you than pineapple or banana. Portion control is still important. 

If you find there are foods that right now you are unprepared to give up, start with portion control. You will not feel the need to binge your cravings if you allow yourself 1/4 of a donut vs. no baked goods ever again. There are many replacements out there like almond flour, coconut flour, stevia, or monk fruit that will replace flour and sugar to make cookies or brownies doable. 

Good luck. Breathe. You can take your time for research. Don't be too hard on yourself as you get started. Make good choices. Sorry for the lengthy comment."

PM_ME_YOUR_DND_SHEET,2022-04-26,1,"Yes it is normal to feel overwhelmed. Does your doctor want you to test 1 hour post meal? Because 2 hours is a much better indicator from all the literature I have seen and been told by my care team. I wouldn't test 1 hour after a meal.

Metformin will help with your levels but it can take some time to work and to get used to. If you're making diet changes it may take some time to see those numbers go down.

Under 180 is a good reading for two hours after a meal. Between 70-130 is *generally* a good before number.

Your numbers will be high in the beginning. We all start off with high numbers, that's kind of how we got here. Over time they should start to trend down, if you're changing your diet or following what the doctor told you.

Don't hesitate to reach out to this sub for support, advice, or knowledge/information. There are a plethora of people who have had this disease for longer than you or I have been alive and are very helpful and supportive."

Id like to second the Americans With Diabetes website recommendation. Ive also allowed myself some treats that are Keto friendly (Hilo Life chips, and Keto fat bombs have been my saving grace.) but of course 1. You still have to treat them as once in awhile treats, and 2. Not all diabetics do well with stuff like that.

I too do well with Berries for a little sweetness that wont mess up my sugar levels (also in moderation). The ADA website helps a lot because it also features recipes that I can cook fairly easily.

Im also on Metformin and Id suggest starting that as soon as your Doc gets you the prescription. I take mine with a meal, and was spared most of the gastrointestinal issues that can come with your body adjusting. That might work for you too.

choodudetoo,2022-05-12,3,"Bread is a tough thing to make keto.

There seems to be two strategies:

  One is to use lots of fiber.  Cardboard has a lot of fiber

  Second is to use ""Modified Starch.""  Problem is for many folks, the ""Modified"" starch spikes their blood glucose just as high as unmodified.  I don't know why, but I suspect some people's gut biome is able to feast on modified starch.

So try some, but test how these bread like objects affect your BG.

 My local Walmart carries the Arnold Keto Bread - it goes the modified starch route.

We have the best results with low carb tortillas.  They go the high fiber route.  Not really bread, but Not spiking the BG is more important.  We even toast them, then build pizza on them and put them back in the oven.

Good Luck!"

once my sugar was down i could go back to my old way of eating but be reasonable about it. a loaf of bread lasts me a month n lives in the freezer! going strict broke all my bad habits. was incredibly hard but my kids were my motivation. today i choose a giant salad instead of grain. 

i too have metabolic syndrome. went on beginning dose medication. upped my exercise. only use olive oil, avocado oil n sesame oil. continued using butter n heavy whipping cream against advice. cut out salt. did more aerobics n climbing stairs!

next appointment might be able to reduce or cut out some medication!"

gerhardpratt,2022-04-28,11,"My story might be relevant to your situation. I am a 65 year old male, this took place two years ago ...

I was on a relatively mild dose of rosuvastatin (10 mg). When I started my A1C was 5.5, which Canadian guidelines classify as the threshold for ""at risk"" (for Type 2 Diabetes). I was not informed of the risk of diabetes by either my PCP or cardiologist. Three years later my A1C was 10.4. When I later discovered the association of statins with diabetes development I was absolutely floored, but neither doctor was at all phased. Following this I developed a lump in my (male) breast for which I underwent a mammogram to receive a diagnosis of gynaecomastia (the development of hormonal breast tissue in men, also associated with statins). At that point I outright refused to take statins, leading to my cardiologist refusing to treat me further. By that time I had done enough research to insist on a CGM, to ""eat to the meter"" and reduce carb intake significantly, to exercise regularly, and to get my weight down nearly 40 lbs. As a result I reduced my triglycerides significantly and I got my  A1C down to 5.1. I held my ground, found a new PCP and cardiologist, and I also found a nutritionist supportive of my diet (another story there).

The diabetes is now officially in remission, the breast lump has disappeared, but I have developed a cataract in one eye that will be operated on. Cataracts are also associated with statins. In a sense I am very lucky to have realized the damage my elevated blood sugars were doing, and I live a much healthier life now. My LDL cholesterol count is slightly higher than the reference level (3.58 mmol/L), so I insisted on an NMR particle count (very rare in Canada), which revealed my LDL is ""Pattern A"" (i.e. *not* a risk factor). I occasionally have to defend my decision to avoid statins, but this last test seems to convince people.

I cannot say for sure that the statins led to my diabetes (T2DM).  I was not leading a healthy life, I was sedentary, and I was eating/drinking far too much sugar. I may still have developed gynocomastia and cataracts without the statins. But I will continue to avoid statins. The ""[NNT](https://www.thennt.com/nnt/statins-persons-low-risk-cardiovascular-disease/)"" (Number Needed to Treat) for any benefit is more than one hundred, and any benefit comes with a comparable risk of diabetes development. There is no statistically significant benefit in terms of all cause mortality."
OhGoodGrief13,2022-04-28,1,My LDL is 2.45 but my doctor wants it below 2.0.  I'm going to change up my diet and see if that helps.

BobBridge,2022-04-30,2,Doctors receive 'awards' from insurance companies for prescribing statins.  I have never even been close to having diabetes but somehow my clown doctor thought it was ok to put Type 2 diabetes in my medical record and then prescribe statins to me.  I guess she'd get a head start on her paperwork since studies are showing that statins increase your risk for developing diabetes.
rraattbbooyy,2022-04-28,6,"Statins are used primarily to treat high cholesterol and reduce the likelihood of further heart problem in people who already have heart disease.  You dont mention whether you have high cholesterol or not, or whether you have any history of heart disease but it doesnt sound like you do.  If you have no heart or cholesterol problem, you probably do not need a statin. In fact, a statin can actually make it harder to control your blood sugar.  I would seek more information before I follow a doctor who wants to medicate me because its standard practice.

DangReadingRabbit,2022-04-28,10,"Considering your health and the fact youll see the doctor regularly because of the diabetes, personally I dont understand the reasoning to be on them. Unless your cholesterol is high, whats the benefit?

Before being diagnosed, my husbands cholesterol was high and the cardiologist put him on a statin as a result of a scare (he thought he was having a heart attack, doctors cleared him but gave the reasoning that preventative medication at his age was good). He hated the side effects. He changed his diet and his cholesterol came down so he came off the statins with approval from his regular doc. 

When he was diagnosed with diabetes, he changed everything and got his type 2 under control with diet and exercise. Even though his weight is still not perfect, we walk daily and he sticks to a very low carb diet. His triglycerides were high soon after starting metformin (a common side effect), so he started taking b12 vitamins and it returned to normal. His primary doctor watches all his numbers closely and with an A1C of 5.5 and normal cholesterol, theres no reason to be on a statin right now.

Im not a fan of unnecessary medication. My husband is the type to listen to docs, but like I said, the side effects were not worth it in his case. You sound very health conscious, so I dont think theres a reason to rush into taking a med you dont need. Watch your numbers close. If your cholesterol starts to creep up, you can reevaluate. 

Just my opinion. Obviously Im a random person on the internet = & but hope sharing our experience is helpful to you."
PurpleKrill,2022-04-28,3,"My cholesterol jumped and Im 34. My endo wants to put me on medication but only when Im done having a family (Im the incubator) as its not an immediate urgent concern. A complication of diabetes is our circulation and that can sometimes allow for plaques to form in places which can be deadly depending on their location or if they dislodge and flow to somewhere else and block blood flow. 

Most of those medications are designed for keeping the walls of your blood vessels slippery or thinning the blood so that plaques cant form.

On the other hand, while statins have their place in specific situations, they are also one of the most over prescribed and profitable drugs on the market.

What is your lipid particle size profile?  How about good to bad lipid ratio?

There's plenty of research that is not funded by pharmaceutical companies out there.  Here's a Google search for just one of them:

https://www.google.com/search?q=cholesterol+code


Remember when the Standard American Diabetic Association diet recommendation for Type 2's was 40 to 60 grams of carb per meat plus two 15 gram snacks per day?  If that did not work we have drugs you can take?   Nowadays ""Eat to Your Meter"" is gaining traction."

jonathanlink,2022-04-28,3,"Its considered part of the standard of care. Once I had my blood sugars under tight control and was doing regular weight lifting sessions, I found the muscle pain from statins intolerable.

I would ask for a particle count, getting small dense LDL, and get the ratio of HDL to TGs. Focusing only on LDL is missing the forest for the trees, imo."

A CACs (Coronary Artery Calcium Score) is also a very vital (out of pocket) test - looking at amount calcium plaque in arteries.

Speaking only for myself, I haven't had any side effects from taking it. My endo has also been lowering my dosage, having gone from 40 mg to 10 mg since the beginning of the year. 

An important factor to remember, or consider, is that your body makes cholesterol. You could be doing all the right things, eating the right foods, and still have high cholesterol. 

As others have sad, and as a patient I have done this, speak to your doctor if you are taking any medications where you are feeling side effects. Some will go away. Others could kill you eventually."

4thshift,2022-04-29,2,"Statins, according one branch of research, may lower cholesterol in people but generally add no cardiovascular benefit to nearly90-somthing-% of people who take them. One large study that advocated for taking ststins, also showed this to be true. And the life-saving effect for those millions of people averages out to about 1 week longer life expectancy. 

Now, if you have had a cardiovascular event or at a significant risk for a negative event, then it is recommended to take them. But, allegedly, half or more of the people who end up in hospital with a cardio event have perfectly acceptable LDL levels, so at best statins seem like a risk reduction  not a guarantee, because LDL levels dont necessarily predict cardio events  not like it is being sold as a public mantra. 

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090112130653.htm

The people who advocate for statins largely insist that side effects are rare, and are a
transient effect or a mass figment of the imagination. My other had certainly says his muscle pain is no imaginary issue. 

They recommend statins for me to, even though my HDL/LDL ratio and Tota Cholesterol and triglycerides are all perfectly norma. Why should I take meds for lipid problems if I dont have lipid problems, doc? Youll need them for 20 years from now. And the hospital requires that we write a prescription for all diabetics If you say so. 

Some research seems to indicate that statins may have other benefits behind cardio vascular events, though. 

So, nobody here is your doctor, nor do they have your body or your health record. So asking us if you should take them or not isnt going to give you great info to deal with, I think. Consult with other physicians, do your research  adjust your meds as necessary and know that there is no agreement on this issue. It seems akin to recommendations to take daily baby aspirin, but I am not a researcher and have only read a tiny fraction of papers on statins. Whichever decision you make, it is not one for you to regret, I should think  because theres not a lot of significant harm or benefit from what Ive seen so far. If you get less cardio problems, and an extra week of life, Inguess that is terrific. If your body is uncomfortable all over, not so much.

Less cruddy food and more physical activity are still the agreed-upon solution that adds significant beneficial results."
pancreaticallybroke,2022-04-28,3,"Here in the UK it's recommended that anyone who has been diabetic for over ten years is placed on a statin. The NHS won't pay for shit unless it's proven over and over again to be useful! 

Statins were designed to lower your cholesterol. Now we know that they also help to protect your heart and whole cardiovascular system from damage. The link between cardiac issues and diabetes is incredibly strong so having looked at the data, for me it's worth it purely down to that. However, there's more research coming out that shows that statins seem to have some protective factors for the kidneys too. This is very early stage research but is really promising. Given that 50% of the dialysis population has some form of diabetes, this could be a huge breakthrough. 

The media likes to kick up a fuss about statins. Some people do react badly to them but there are a ton of different statins. If you get any side effects at all, you swap to a different one. 

Do your research and look at actual medical research on this or just trust your doctor. The absolute best time to take statins is when you're fit and well to help you stay that way. You wouldn't wait for the heart attack to happen before you got fit."
keithmk,2022-04-28,3,"There are a couple of myths about cholesterol and statins. The first is that diet can make a significant difference to cholesterol levels. No, the greater amount of statins in your blood is produced by your body, not absorbed with your food. The other one is that statins are just to control cholesterol. Not true. Statins help to stabilise plaque in your arteries, thereby helping protect from coronary heart disease and strokes. Diabetes does increase your risk of heart disease. To refuse to take them is foolhardy. As mentioned by others, if your body reacts badly to one type then get your doctor to change it for another type"

crowort,2022-05-01,3,Ive been over the max for home testing a few times. So Im unsure what my levels have been too. On diagnosis the doctor told my family I might not make it and I was as Ill as I could get.

ClayWheelGirl,2022-05-01,1,t2d here. same. ive been asked to check into the ER if my sugar goes beyond 240
CursedEarth-Pizza,2022-05-05,1,"Any reason they came up with 240? I dont even start feeling sick until like 300-400, and most medical documents Ive seen online also seem to indicate ER after maintaining 300-400 for a few hours or longer."
ClayWheelGirl,2022-05-05,2,"so i have the kind of diabetes that is sensitive according to the advice nurses n doctors. when my sugars hit 160 i shut down literally. extreme fatigue. my eyes close. my brain gets wooly n vision blurred. i cant continue a conversation. in a sense it sucks n in another sense im grateful.

i am very lucky that i have such supportive friends n family. for our gatherings a walk after a meal has become a tradition whether i need it or not. i am surrounded by good cooks and generational recipes. i am NOT giving up on that. i am also surrounded by outliers like young cooks and bakers who enjoy it. hell no im not going to refuse their chocolate chip cookies. i want to encourage their passion. but they also know i have diabetes and i will NEVER eat sugar or flour on an empty stomach.

i am afraid of my high symptoms so if i know im going to cheat i seriously prepare the best i can. i go for an hour walk before food. i usually dont eat bfast, but if im going for a cheat lunch then i eat bfast so that im not eating a cheat meal on an empty stomach. by empty i mean after the night. bfast usually is a medium apple with pb.

i grew up with diabetes in the family. i know how it isnt a cookie cutter formula for all. it is a range. i think diabetes exploded worldwide in the 50s and 60s. as time has progressed n more diabetics are genetic the disease is changing. the numbers are a guide. i had a real good conversation with an advice nurse when i was on prednisone n my sugars were going whacko. she was stressing on each of us knowing our numbers according to our symptoms. she said they put first priority on symptoms n then numbers. plus the fact that new research takes 40 to 50 years to reach the doctors and the public. we are holding on to very old ideas when medical world is making strides in exponential speed. 

for instance i dont make any difference between prediabetes n diabetes. i question what the difference is to that arbitrary number. more health issues as a diabetic so more monitoring.

heck why are we even paying attention to the symptom n ignoring the disease - insulin resistance. taking metformin is like taking tylenol for a headache. when IR is such a huge epidemic bigger than Covid, why is no one talking about IR and watching your diet that needs to begin during teenage years. by the time u get prediabetes its already been 10 - 15 years of IR.

btw heres another weird thing. stress is bigger for me than diet. if i am stressed out then no matter what i eat i spike high.

so my most important focus is stress control n sleep and drinking water. everything else comes later."

Asbolus_verrucosus,2022-05-14,3,"The development team has since expanded and is actively working on the next generation prototype, suitable for human studies

What I said is correct. The devices theyve made this far are not for human trials"
CaseyBF,2022-05-14,-1,"Notice how I said not ""quite"" right. I'm not disagreeing with you entirely but I took your saying they don't have a working technology as that it doesn't work to detect glucose. Perhaps that's not how you meant it in which case I'm just arguing semantics. 
They have measured glucose using this technology. Suitable for human use is their way of saying that the consistency isn't there for use on monitoring glucose in diabetics. Inaccurate measurements can mean life or death for some diabetics which is why FDA approval for things like this takes a long time. They have talked about it multiple times in investor presentations and at conferences."

The medical side of MMAT started as a passion project for the CEO when his wife was diagnosed and going through cancer treatment and wanted to find a way that would allow for easier&amp; better scanning/imaging for early diagnosis of cancers, etc. Look into their mammowise: https://investingnews.com/daily/life-science-investing/medical-device-investing/metamaterials-medical-diagnostic-device-mri/

The reason these products aren't on the market yet is because the time and capital it takes to get to production scale.

pissweakpancreas,2022-05-14,1,I read a while back about someone trialling a CGM earring. Never heard about it again but would be so keen to try it!!
Lausannea,2022-05-14,1,"I love how nondiabetics think our biggest want is a pain free way of measuring glucose.

What we want are more accurate and convenient to use CGMs, better insulin, better pumps, and better healthcare where all of this stuff is accessible to any diabetic who wants and needs it. Right now most of us aren't eligible for half the stuff we already have available because it's deemed unnecessary through arbitrary guidelines.

There are lancing devices available that minimize pain already, and more than 80% of my fingersticks don't hurt. Looking at the website... who wants a huge, stationary 'home hub' device? Talk about inconvenient and a waste of space?

Good example of ""Just because you can doesn't mean you should"" imo."
ShrekVictim,2022-05-14,1,Actually as I diabetic and someone who passes out from the sight of blood this was actually very convenient for me
Lausannea,2022-05-14,1,"That's unfortunate. It also doesn't change my opinion on things like this.

Accessibility to the tools we have right now is already lacking. I officially can't get a CGM cause I'm not pregnant enough, not young enough or out of control enough.

What makes you think devices like this will even be covered by insurance, or accessible to people who may need them like you? We can barely get enough test strips for regular glucometers covered. I get 4 test strips a DAY as a type 1 on insulin in my country with better healthcare than the US.

Our priority should be to fix the healthcare system and our access to our tools before we invest in technology that will likely not get covered to begin with. What good are tools we don't get to use???"
ShrekVictim,2022-05-14,1,"A lot of hospitals will be buying this along with their state of the art MRI tech.


Reducing time to test 
No strips needed, one time purchase just like a blood pressure arm band. One hub can be used in a docs office and used on thousands coming in for check ups. 

Their MRI stuff is crazier tho, dramatically reduces time for a scan whilst keeping resolution the same or higher."
Lausannea,2022-05-14,1,"... IF it passes trials, maybe they will. Depends on how accurate it is. It may not pass the ability to be reliable enough for diagnostics. Lots of ifs at work here.

Still wondering what Eutopia you live in where you feel this stuff gets the kind of coverage you're implying though lol."

bionic_human,2022-05-24,8,Dexcom still owns \~1.75% of Tandem.
Gargle-Blaster,2022-05-24,4,Would they be forced to divest from tandem?  I suppose the government doesnt care much about an oligopoly these days.
bionic_human,2022-05-24,6,"I don't see why. It's not enough of a stake for them to have any sort of control.

Plus, at this point, everything between Dexcom and Insulet at this point is still ""rumor"" (although I've heard it from industry folks not tied to either company).

Dexcom may just be floating a rumor to see how the other players in the industry (and financial markets) will respond."
MohKohn,2022-05-24,2,Things have been better on that front the past 2 years. I'd give a significant chance this deal won't go through

bionic_human,2022-05-24,7,Libre integration cant happen until the FDA approves a Libre device as an iCGM.
Gargle-Blaster,2022-05-24,6,I hate to judge something I have no personal experience with. But the random browsing on Reddit would indicate that Dexcom beats freestyle everyday. Fingers crossed tandem keeps Dexcom.
Sprig3,2022-05-25,2,"Given how different the omnipod is from the Tslim, I wouldn't think Dexcom would choose to stop working with them even if the acquisition occurs.  There are many people who do not want a pod for all sorts of reasons and while the decision to stop working with Tandem might drive some consumers to Omnipod 5 instead, it probably wouldn't be huge and would be outweighed by loss of revenue from Tandem customers."
eiscego,2022-05-24,1,"I've never had a dexcom and have only been on the Libre 2 for about a year. Libre 2 is much cheaper than dexcom and there are third-party apps that turn it into a real CGM (instead of requiring to scan). I wouldn't switch right now if I could. That being said, I do not use a pump so I'm not sure how the integration between CGM and pump compares between the two but if I had to guess, I'd guess dexcom wins that one."
silk7866,2022-05-25,4,"I have used both Dexcom g6 &amp; Libre 2.  Dexcom is much more accurate, and being on a pump, I need an accurate cgm so that my numbers are right and my A1C keeps improving.  Libre 2 would be between 30-50 points off, both up and down, where Dexcom, when I keep it calibrated, is never off more than 10 points."
Sprig3,2022-05-25,2,"Yeah, the base tech is very similar between the two (glucose oxidase coating on flexible wire), but every study I've seen shows Dexcom slightly more accurate than Libre 2.  (and then annecdotally, some people are better with Libre 2 than Dexcom and some better with Dexcom)

Very curious how the Libre 3 fares, but haven't seen any large comparisons."
surfwacks,2022-05-25,5,"Im sure it varies for everyone but the dexcom is actually way cheaper for me compared to the first libre, dont know about the second libre. Thats cool about the third party apps though, no scanning is my favorite thing about dexcom lol"
seiyria,2022-05-25,4,Libre has always been 75/mo over the counter (both 1 and 2). I couldn't get a fraction of a dexcom for that. I'd guess if you have insurance it might be covered but that's definitely not true for everyone.
surfwacks,2022-05-25,2,"Yeah sorry when I put it varies for everyone I meant with insurance! I know the cash price is different

Edit: also libre was $75 a month for me with insurance but when I tried looking for it with goodrx and other discount programs like that it was around $160 a month (still cheaper than dexcom out of pocket), I wish I knew where to find it $75 out of pocket lol"
seiyria,2022-05-25,2,I have no idea how the discount boosted the price. I was getting it without insurance from walgreens (cvs?) for 75/month. I had no idea it could even cost more than that.
surfwacks,2022-05-26,1,Crazy how much it can vary!

elsteve9,2022-05-25,1,Insulet is amazing with their customer service and ease of ordering. Dexcom used to be the same way but is now absolutely awful when it comes to customer service and tech support. I hope they dont acquire Insulet.
Fun_Mistake4299,2022-05-17,27,"I had this exact discussion with somebody on r/askreddit some months ago. They were adamant about how eating habits is what kills a diabetic, and I kept telling him diabetes is about lack of insulin, not sugar.

MarcusForrest,2022-05-17,18,"This is sadly a **huge** challenge/problem amongst all types of diabetics... The lack of information, training, knowledge. I truly think diabetes is one of the worst ''known'' diseases in terms of misinformation or inaccuracies or myths.

&amp;nbsp;

There is an observable phenomenon about the impact of its portrayal in popular culture _(movies, shows, and it is always **wrong**)_ but also jokes _(you know, diabetics joke of a bad taste)_ - those reinforce inaccuracies and myths about the disease.

&amp;nbsp;

It is increasingly frustrating having to deal with people who clearly know nothing of the disease, yet try to tell _you_ you're the one who's wrong..."
Fun_Mistake4299,2022-05-17,11,"Yeah. I wouldn't mind it so much if the person goes ""Oh, but I thought.... Is that not how it is?"". Or something like that, because it shows you the other person is interested in learning more about it."
Sufficient-Ad6637,2022-05-17,10,Thanks for the information.  I didn't know the exact cause of dka and appreciate learning something new.
MarcusForrest,2022-05-17,14,"To add some details about insulin and ketones - 

* Insulin is also a ketone regulator, so that is why insulin is less effective on **blood glucose** when there are ketones in the body, as part of the insulin is working on regulating ketones rather than regulating blood glucose.

* This is why ketosis can be dangerous to diabetics - without proper insulin levels, the ketones can ''spill'' into the blood as there isn't enough insulin to regulate it. KETO diets need to be properly discussed with your endocrinologist as it is a diet that pushes the body into entering a state of ketosis, which can lead to ketoacidosis in diabetics - a potentially life-threatening condition."
RollerSkatingHoop,2022-05-18,2,can be bad for type 1 or 2 or all?
MarcusForrest,2022-05-18,5,It can be bad to anyone with insufficient amounts of insulin  - which is why it is typically worse for T1Ds which are insulin-dependant
Dangerous-Corner-989,2022-05-18,2,"DKA mostly occurs in type 1, HHS is usually what type 2 have to be concerned with.  DKA is quick onset, HHS is not.  At any rate, both are considered medical emergencies."
cssgtr,2022-05-18,3,"&gt; This is why ketosis can be dangerous to diabetics - without proper insulin levels, the ketones can ''spill'' into the blood as there isn't enough insulin to regulate it.

It is also important to note that mild ketones caused by ketosis is beneficial to the body and the brain actually prefers it as a energy source to glucose. Ketosis and mild ketones is perfectly fine so long as you have an adequate basil rate."
MarcusForrest,2022-05-18,7,"&gt; It is also important to note that mild ketones caused by ketosis is beneficial to the body 

For non-diabetics _(as they have no insulin issues)_ - but remember that ketosis ` ketoacidosis

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;  the brain actually prefers it as a energy source to glucose.

Interesting - do you have any sources? The sources I have mention the brain **can** and will use ketones as main energy source _(when glucose sources aren't available)_, but nothing mentions the brain **prefers** it over glucose

&gt; Ketosis and mild ketones is perfectly fine so long as you have an adequate basil [sic] rate.

Yes - as long as it doesn't become ketoacidosis. For some, it doesn't depend solely on basal rate _(especially those on MDI)_, it is really about overall insulin intake _(whether basal or bolus)_"

MarcusForrest,2022-05-18,2,Thanks for this! I'll go through their linked sources
Sehri437,2022-05-17,8,This is very helpful. I have heard it repeated often enough that hyperglycaemia can lead to DKA that I had come to think it was another direct cause
MarcusForrest,2022-05-17,8,"&gt; I have heard it repeated often enough that hyperglycaemia can lead to DKA

When I was diagnosed about 19 years ago, the same thing was said during my ''diabetes training'' - that DKA is **CAUSED** by hyperglycemia... And no details on the mechanism of action. I only learned about the real cause _(and mechanism)_ a few years ago"
Lausannea,2022-05-18,5,"Hi there, can you add that treating ketoacidosis must require fluids and carbohydrates alongside the insulin?

The carbs are necessary to stop the body from continuing the ketosis (especially important with eDKA, but also with hyperglycemic DKA), and as dehydration often accompanies DKA, water is a must.

This is also why someone who cannot keep water down while in DKA must call for an ambulance immediately."

DiabeticCumshot,2022-05-18,2,"Yup I learned this the hard way with a hospital visit due to a minor DKA! 

I went on a no carb diet (to regulate my insulin levels) and was having way less insulin than my body was used to which caused traces of acid to be found in my blood stream. Never dieting again, I eat a ton of Keto meals but now I purposely add carbs to my meals to make sure I get enough insulin each day! Might be harder to maintain my blood glucose levels when eating more carbs but Im not trying to go into a DKA ever again, so give me those carbs baby"
InspectorLD,2022-05-18,2,"Can I ask, how do you test for ketones in your blood at home? My doctor's office is taking a very hands-off approach to my treatment. So I have little diabetes education. Used a light-keto diet to manage my glucose. Had no idea this could be a factor.

Thank you for the info dump. I learned a lot today."
MarcusForrest,2022-05-18,2,"&gt; Can I ask, how do you test for ketones in your blood at home?

Of course!

&amp;nbsp;

There are actually at least 2 ways to test at home:

* Through **urine** - there are test strips for urine ketones usually available at drugstores/pharmacies. While not as accurate as blood ketone testing, it can still give an idea of ketone levels in the body.
 * Very simple, you simply urinate on a strip and compare the colour to a chart
* Through **blood** - like you mentioned - much like blood glucose readers, there exists **Ketone Blood Readers/Meters**
 * Same deal as blood glucose meters: finger prick, get a drop of blood, get that blood on a test strip plugged in the reader, wait a few seconds, and you'll get your results

&amp;nbsp;

**ABOUT BOOD KETONES LEVELS**

If you do a blood ketone test: 

&amp;nbsp;

* = d than 0.6mmol/L is a normal reading. 

* =á 0.6 to 1.5mmol/L means you're at a slightly increased risk of DKA and you should test again in 2 hours. 

* =å e 1.6 to 2.9mmol/L means you're at an increased risk of DKA and should contact your diabetes team or GP as soon as possible.

this_is_squirrel,2022-05-07,7,Sounds like the drop in your glucose level is presenting as hypoglycemia. It may or may not actually be hypoglycemia but if youre used to running high then its not uncommon to feel low even with a normal BG.

walkstwomoons2,2022-05-17,5,"OK, this is not an unusual reaction, doctors dont help tell you what you should eat and what you should do. I went through the same thing and this is what I found out:

Ask your doctor to hook you up with a nutritionist, usually insurance will pay for this if you are diabetic. If not, call your grocery stores and see if they have nutritionists on site. They are usually paid by the store and will help you out with some recommendations.

Meanwhile, stick with vegetables and meat. Vegetables have the lowest carbs, and meat is something you need to be eating.  Make sure its low fat meat, ask your butcher which ones are best for a diabetic.

There are lots of people out there who can help give you advice, you do not have to depend solely on your doctor for that. 

Get some exercise, even if its only walking. In fact I lost 150 pounds by walking. I walked 15 minutes four times a day, during my work breaks. Slowly I built up and eventually I walked a marathon. You can do it, I know its hard, but you can do it.

Get your rest, lack of sleep will also cause you problems.

And stop worrying, stress can actually make your blood sugar go higher.

DealioD,2022-05-17,2,"The green leafy vegetables are really good for you. Kale, decent lettuce ( not iceberg ), broccoli, think along those lines.
Also look up the glycemic scale. If you are watching out for carbs be careful. Beans are considered high in carbs, but they are low on the glycemic scale and very good to help regulate blood glucose. Indian foods are really good too. Dals are types of lentils and there are tons of recipes that use Different types of Dal.  
Be careful of Oatmeal, it affects different people differently. I cant eat oat meal with anything in it, and I cant eat it in the morning.   
Watch out for blood glucose spike in the morning after you first get up. Eating a lot of protein first thing ( at least for me ) helps lower my morning spike.  
One of the things that Im finding is eating small meal throughout the day helps better maintain a more steady level than not eating or eating here and there. I mean, if I think about it it makes sense, that I dont process glucose well so that it will rise without me doing something about it, but I still have a hard time wrapping my head around the fact that if I dont eat, my blood glucose seems to go up.   
Watch out for fruit, watermelon and grapes can spike my blood glucose. Bananas and cherries dont seem to do that as much.

LucidNightmares5,2022-05-18,2,"Youre feeling exactly what I felt when newly diagnosed a few months ago and while I am still learning and inexperienced, I hope what I say helps you- I had to see a nutritionist nurse to learn this.


I was afraid to eat anything and trying to eat keto and stick to under 20g carbs per DAY total. I was also fasting a lot. The biggest question I had for my diabetes educator was whyyy are my numbers going up when Im not even eating?!


It turns out, I needed MORE food- 3 meals and 2-3 snacks a day, plus a good bit more carbs. I learned that a serving of carbs is 15g and a snack should be a serving (and the right kind of carbs, low glycemic), and a meal should be 2-3 serving choices so 30-45g carbs PER MEAL, 3 times a day. And again, the right kind of carbs and a proportionate amount of protein and low glycemic carb choices. I was doubtful but my blood sugar went way down. I was still going over levels of 200-220+ until I followed the meal plan my nutritionist gave me. (BIG NOTE you need to follow what your own medical team tells you to do in your unique case, but from what I understand this is ADAs pretty standard Type 2 dietary recommendation).


Eating more and eating carbs, and learning that I can eat a whole piece of toast with my breakfast and also a serving of blueberries, and eat carb servings again at snack and lunch and dinner times, and learning how to portion it helped me. My numbers are still not the best, but I NEVER go over 170 after 2 hours after eating and my fasting numbers got to under 115- when they were 140-160. Then I started a new medicine that helps also.


So, you might be able to eat more than you think and things you dont think youre allowed, but do talk to your doctor and if you can see a diabetes educator then its worth it. Theyll take into account your cholesterol etc."
mistier,2022-05-18,1,"Im trying to convince myself that carbs arent the devil unless Im over eating them. I didnt have a carb heavy diet before, no more than a normal person.

if youre not on insulin theres lots of snacks and such with low carbs. but also you need carbs to survive. they are nourishing and good for you. dont let diabetes and some foolish doctors or random people think you shouldnt have carbs. its a long explanation but eating carbs is actually super necessary to maintaining stable numbers. 

some snack ideas 
-popcorn 
-peanut butter 
-sugar free jello 
-watermelon 
-if you crave juice (I did lmao) flavored water is great 
-rice chips 
-carrots, zucchini, cucumbers, all that kind of stuff

2. Diabetics are not all the same in what they can eat and it can vary with your weight and stressed status and exercise. It will be frustrating. Stay calm and be a scientist. Eat and measure at multiple times. 
3. It is worth it to try a continuous glucose monitor cgm like a Libre 14 day -look for one with a phone app and check past Reddit conversations. Likely you have to pay out of pocket. Ask MD for Rx. You dont have to use them forever but it helps when learning to test easily anytime you want. There is a small learning curve with the cgm..you will likely scrape it off in at least one doorway. But you get immediate feedback on improvements.
4. My MD said avoid beans, corn, rice and potatoes. That has been pretty good advice. My testing ahowed I cant even take a spoon of any rice without shooting up but corn is okay with protein.  
5. Expect learning about this to be equivalent to the hours in a college course. Do whatever you do to learn important material. The exam is your aic every few months 

Please eat, lows are as bad as highs.
Best wishes!"
mistier,2022-05-18,1,Thank you! Can I ask for some clarification? Say I eat a sandwich. Carbs. But peanut butter has protein. Would that be alright? Because I love peanut butter sandwiches as a snack and as a quick meal with some sliced apples or carrots.
AliasNefertiti,2022-05-18,1,Only a glucose test would tell for sure if that works for you. Peanut butters can have a lot of sugar in them so buy carefully. If the bread is too much do open face or on celery.
mistier,2022-05-18,1,"Im buying some celery today, actually. Disappointed that my favorite snacks have to leave my diet. It is what it is I guess."
AliasNefertiti,2022-05-18,1,With time and appropriate meds there is a possibility of reintroducing some as long as you monitor.

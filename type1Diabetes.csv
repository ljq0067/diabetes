NUliano93,2022-05-28,Calf pain,"Hey yall, so Thursday night I went out drinking with some friends.

Woke up Friday morning and realized Id been without insulin for about 7 hours and I clocked myself at 343. Got all that under control, but now I have pretty bad calf soreness in both legs.

EESW_Tm69,2022-05-27,"ALA really works, but isn't really useful for us","I've read somewhere that ALA (Alpha-Lipoic-Acid) supplementation could improve insulin sensitivity... well I know that lowering my sensitivity wont really help unless its reanimating my pancreas but why not.

So to the results: Taking 600mg ALA in the morning on empty stomach per day for a week showed no effects at all. not a single change in average insulin dosage. (was 45u per day the week before, was still \~45u per day a week after)  
However, Taking 1200mg ALA (In the same time and conditions) Showed significant increase in insulin sensitivity for the first \~6 hours after consumption, the insulin sensitivity was so high that I kept getting low from my long-range insulin.  


summary: ALA supplementation works and reduces insulin resistance for a short time at higher dose.

mellyyclaire,2022-05-27,freestyle libre 2,"Hi, I've been using the freestyle libre 1 for awhile now but recently my endo recommended I switch to the libre 2. What I really like about the 1 is that it has a separate reader. I don't always have my phone on me and the battery of the reader lasts much longer than my phone so I like not having to depend on a phone. My endo said the 2 also has a reader so I thought perfect, I'll make the switch. 

But my pharmacy doesn't have any in stock and said they are unable to order from Abbott. I looked into it myself online and found nowhere to order the reader. Abbott has photos on it on their website but no option to actually order it.

So I'm wondering if anyone has had any luck recently getting the freestyle libre 2 reader? I live in BC, Canada.

SupportMoist,2022-06-15,What is wrong with my basal and how can I fix it?,"I have an endo and an educator and will be seeing the latter on Saturday but since I continue to have problems I was hoping maybe you guys can figure this out or have experienced something similar. 

I have only been diagnosed a month and experience random insulin resistance it feels like. Im on multi day injections. On Friday, my educator switched up my plan to: 22 units Lantus at 10pm, Humalog for meals, dividing by 5 carbs for breakfast and lunch, dividing by 8 for dinner. Correction is to 120 and divide by 30 for amount of units. 

The first 24 hours of this I had a near perfect day 94% in range which has never happened. I was thrilled.

Since then, I am low every morning (today my Libre woke me up 3x starting at 5AM for low glucose), and the second I eat breakfast, no matter what it is or how much I bolus, I hit 200-250. I stay there through lunch no matter my correction or what I eat or bolus and it doesnt start to come down until early evening. I correct with dinner and thats when I start finally being in the green, only to shoot up again near 10PM (Im assuming the Lantus wears off a little early) and then I take my Lantus and it starts going down. 

What is happening here? Originally I was waking up really high when I took the Lantus in the morning so we switched it to evening, which helped a lot as Im not waking up already screwed. But I cant stand the low alarms so early in the AM, and then the second I eat, it doesnt even matter even though the Lantus is clearly still in my system! And why does it fix itself in the evening even though my Lantus is wearing off, just to spike again before I need more?

Does anyone have advice or ideas? I cant get a pump yet due to other medical concerns. Why was the first day so perfect and now I have weird insulin resistance just morning and afternoon? Im so frustrated. I should also mention Ive always been neurotic about nutrition, have a food scale, and mostly eat at home so Im pretty confident I know whats in my food. It also doesnt matter how low carb or accurate my breakfast is, this happens no matter what. Even Catalina Crunch with a bolus took me to 250!",1,0.67,2

2. what snacks do you keep in your car? i wanna keep a snack bag in my car for when im low/going low, but since its getting hot out now, its hard to find things that dont melt.

3. what are your favorite juices for when youre low? i never really drink juice for a low so im not sure whats best carb wise and taste wise. i like all those cranberry grape or cranberry apple kind of juices. cranberry mixed with something is always good to me. 

4. what are some good bags for diabetic supplies on the go? i have a very small makeup bag for my supplies that i keep in my purse, but i wanna use it to hold low snacks in my car and i want something new to carry in my purse. most small ones that i can find dont really have room for lots of snacks or infusion sets and things like that, but i dont want something HUGE.

funkel1989,2022-05-31,"Might be going on a pump, need some advice","Hello everyone,

Today, in a meeting with my endo, she informed me that she is testing me for Type 1 instead of Type 2 and is considering putting me on a pump. She was able to provide me a pamphlet for the t:slim x2 pump but said that there were many more and asked me to do some research to see what I might want to go with. They did not have any other information in the office at the time (she seemed surprised when the nurses told her this lol).

She asked me to call my insurance and see what is covered and get the details from them to do the research and but they are telling me I need codes so they can tell me what's covered. I don't have these yet because until the tests are back there isn't a diagnosis. 

Can anyone tell me some insulin pumps out there so I can research what people are most commonly using today or if you have a recommendation for specific ones, I'd really appreciate it? I'd rather not get something that looks great and then ends up being a nightmare (went through this with hearing aids for my wife...have to wait 3 years to get a new set)",1,0.6,17

kayleighmich711,2022-05-30,Question about neuropathy,"I (20f) have been a type 1 for almost 6 years now, when I was diagnosed I had an 16 a1c and a glucose over 900. After a week long icu stay I managed to get my a1c down to about 7.5 when I tested again a few months later. 

I have a dexcom, but I haven't always been the greatest at controlling my blood sugar and my a1c has been slowing rising these past couple of years. Recently, however I started having what I believe are early symptoms of neuropathy in my feet, numbness in the tip of one of my toes along with some other symptoms. This past month or two I have been on top of my diabetes. I rarely go over 170 after I eat (with a few exceptions) and mainly stay at 100-130 throughout the day and fasting/sleeping I stay at 70. I know it takes time to heal and start noticing change, but somehow it feels like my neuropathy is getting worse. I've noticed increasing numbess in larger areas of my feet and pins and needles more often (I used to only feel it in my right foot, but now my left is starting too). I thought maybe my dex was off so I started checking with a meter more often, but no, my dex is very accurate.

Has anyone else experienced this? Is it supposed to get worse before it gets better? Am I just more sensitive now then when I was constantly high? Is it too early to notice a difference? Just a little concerned.",1,1,3

How did you cope and stabilise back your bs and did your insulin intake eventually reduce?

Also on another slight note, Im guessing you dont take it when have glucose tablets since theyre in sugar form. I never got a follow up appointment, told by my gp I had it and given the tab and just gone with the flow since. Currently 2 tablets per main meal, 1 per snack (300 mg tablets)

timeforgoomy,2022-06-06,i absolutely cannot lose weight and dunno what else to do next to starve,"Edit: please note where i said a few days. I work in behavioural health facilities, i know all about starvation lol. I'm being half serious/sarcastic. Stop focusing on a single word.


When I say I have tried everything, I mean it. Meatless, extra veggies, low sodium, low carb, extra protein, low calorie, exercise, gluten free, dairy free etc. What the hell else am I supposed to do? In the last 4 weeks I've put back on the 14 lbs I lost (from starvation because depression). At that time I was only eating grapes, tangerines and drinking large coffees. I never got low but I also never tested and didn't have a CGM. I don't think I was high because I wasn't urinating often and I wasn't taking medicine.

I do go to the gym when I can, but I'm a CNA and I don't even get breaks half the time. I'm sweating balls lifting, pushing, walking, pulling, sometimes running. So it's not like I'm just sitting on my ass.

I eat pretty wholesomely, I take a bunch of supplements. I'd say the one thing I fail at is drinking water. I hate water. I have to remember to just chug it but that makes me sick. I have a filtered water bottle because there's never any filters at any of the facilities I work at.

My a1c is 9% (6 months ago it was 12 or 13) so that's a significant improvement but still not exactly how I want it. Don't have a doc right now, mine walked out and was replaced with a dumb bitch who refuses to help me or even write me prescriptions because I wont see her after she messed up my prescriptions THREE times.

Anywho I'm seriously considering just not eating. Maybe my body needs a hard reset for a few days. I get down to the 40s at work. I'm very sensitive to carbs so at home I'm up and down. Even though I take medication often. Seems like my medication doesn't really work. And yes, I change areas where injected.

Anyone else have this issue before and managed to fix it? I'm 5ft and now nearly 160. I have no kids. My sisters say I look the same but I want to lose the damn back rolls already. And the stomach. Just the front of my stomach is large, but not where my ribs are. I have an hourglass waist line (sorta?) But the front pertudes. I've had my thyroid checked multiple times despite constant cravings for particular things, overeating and the weight gain. Typically I eat 1200-1500 calories a day. Some days I'm in a shit mood and I eat more. I've been drinking a lot of tea, I don't really drinm juce or soda and like I said, I eat a lot of whole food. I plan on buying from local butchers instead of the store noe because I'm thinking the hormones and whatnot in cornfed animals is another culprit.

I'm also bipolar and I take one medication that helps with hunger and another that I think? Can cause weight gain. I've only been on it like 3-4 weeks, that's not really enough time for me to say this is the issue. I have to take it for sleep. It takes 3-6 weeks for certain types of medication to be in your body. Most of the time I sleep okay (not the last two days).

I'm trying to keep my sugars below 200. But they easily drop down to as low as 40 (probably slightly more but dexcom cant see past 400 or under 40). I'll be buying liquid IV and chugging in the morning and before bed. I'm trying to stick to 1000-1200 calories for now. I don't know why I have pregnant cravings when I'm not pregnant by any means. I'm never hungrh but you'll always find me eating. It's insane. I no longer bring lunch to work because I know I have 0 self control when I get home (and again, I never get a break anyways). I'll bring yogurt or a banana and I drink a glucerna on my way to work. If there's anything I can do to make my lose the cravings or even change the taste of foods so they sicken me the way they did when I was depressed, that would be helpful until my body gets used to not eating. I'm like a rabid dog that needs to be shot lmfao.

When I'm low I usually drink caprisun because it's the only thing I keep around that will raise my glucose. I don't use fake sugar. Tastes like shit. Because it is shit. Lol. Not good for your body. Monk fruit is okay but it's still mixed with another ingredient and it's expensive so I use it very sparingly and rarely. With tea, I use raw honey. I always ask for milk alternatives when able.

I'm desperate so whatever your experience is, I'd like to hear it. Going to call around offices on Thursday but covid messed everything up and no one is taking patients or they're out on maternity leave.

I thought, oh I bet if I do a hard shut-off (plugging in and holding power down for like 30 seconds) it will do the trick. It did, but it also did the trick of forcing me to ""load"" again, involving filling tubing that was already filled, THEN I had less than 50u in there and it made me add more insulin, then it made me fill the tubing again. So I've got like 21 units of insulin in the rug now and it also erased my iob, etc, but I got the screen I wanted. >!

\-----

Hello!

I'm all out of Dexcom sensors as I recently switched insurers and couldn't get appointment in the new system until later in July. But even though I haven't started a new sensor, my TSlim is showing the CGM screen as if it's just waiting for a new sensor, vs the screen you get when you have no CGM attached.

That is, mine is the top image, and I want it to be the bottom image.

I've turned off controlIQ and looked at every pump menu several times and cannot figure this out. It seems like in the past, if I didn't start a new sensor after a certain amount of time it would set itself back to the non-CGM screen, but this has been like this for about 15 hours now. Maybe I need to wait longer? I will contact tandem if no one knows.

We've had a hard enough teaching the school nurse to do this well, so I'm wondering if there are any tools available that I don't know about.

Our easiest, dumbed down strategy has been to give a fixed blood sugar to snack (less than 100), then the snack is based on the change in blood sugar - bigger drop means bigger snack.  The pain point is that her Dexcom app widget and her TSlim pump don't show that change number.  We use xDrip+, Sugarmate, and Nightscout, but none of these things are accessible to her on her devices.

So I'm pondering whether to develop an app myself that has an iPhone widget showing the change in blood sugar number (maybe the last several, an average of the last 3, etc).  I could also calculate the appropriate snack and display the snack in the widget.  Not sure the challenges involved in tapping into the bg data and doing iPhone widgets that are visible while the phone is locked.

cahovi,2022-06-05,strange low symptoms (?),"I'm just wondering whether that's just a thing for me, or something y'all know as well.

I went low today - as I went for a walk after lunch. Nothing too dramatic from the numbers, but the symptoms were bad. I wasn't able to walk properly anymore. I'm not sure how to describe it - basically my movements were rather abrupt, like a robot with wonky control. I just couldn't control putting one foot in front of the other, I'm guessing mainly the speed of the movement? It was all very strange. 

But it went away by itself. I sat down for a minute (as I wasn't sure I'd be able to keep walking without falling down), and it was OK again after a couple of seconds. Like, literally 30m away from where I live. I didn't check manually - according to Libre, 63 with an arrow pointing down - but a glass of juice and nothing else happened. After sitting down, I could walk again as though nothing had happened. Idk what that was. 

What would you say - diabetes related, or something else? Basically - do I need to see a doc because of this?",2,1,5

I've been using Libre 2 for a while, and always used it with the Libre2 reader rather than the phone. I decided to stop doing diabetes like a caveperson and start using the phone app.

I found out the alarm would only work if the sensor has been started with the phone. It would also appear that it uses bluetooth to talk to the phone. On the back of that, I got a few questions that I'm sure some of you badasses can answer:

&amp;#x200B;

1. If I start a sensor with the phone, will the alarm for the reader still be able to alarm for that sensor?
2. Does this constant bluetooth have a significant impact on my phone's battery life?
3. How is the phone alarm range compared to the reader alarm range? I was pretty impressed with the reader's alarm range, hoping the phone will be as good!
4. How's the phone's ability to alarm through clothes? Again, I was pretty impressed with the reader/sensor alarming the reader in my left pocket while my sensor is on the right arm, inside the sleeve of a leather jacket!

In the initial few weeks it was really rough, then things got a bit better. When we got on the OmniPod I thought everything was going to be great, but he started to hate the pump because of mistakes I was making with it (not pinching up during insertion, not having a solvent to get the adhesive &amp; pump off his skin). Before we fixed that he was asking to go back to MDI, which after seeing the control and freedom the pump was going to give him sent me into a spiral. Thankfully after addressing some of the problems he sees the benefits of the pump and wants to stay on it.

Then a few days ago we got a blood test back which if I'm reading correctly indicates he's also got Celiac. We haven't said anything to him yet because we haven't heard back from his doctor, but it's hitting me hard.

Bookish_Gambino,2022-06-10,This week's edition of the graphic novel Chronic,"[CHRONIC #3 is ready for hungry eyes!](https://mulberrytreehouse.substack.com/p/chronic-4?s=r)

(*Chronic* is a free, serialized graphic novel. A free subscription delivers each issue to your email inbox or Substack app every Friday, or you can read it on my Substack home page.)

*This week, Elle lands in the hospital after she is diagnosed with  Type 1 diabetes in 1980. She quickly refers to the place as Hospital  Whack-a-doo because of its surreal atmosphere, employees, and patients.  But she may meet a potential ally soon&*

I know what it's like to be Type 1; I've had it for nearly 45 years. I decided to create this story because I needed a reminder of not only what it was like to be newly-diagnosed, but also to communicate what it was like for diabetics in the days before insulin was discovered. On difficult days with my diabetes, I find some comfort when I think about the diabetes treatment timeline from 1921 to present day, and I see how quickly tech is now moving us along to better treatments and a possible cure.

_mjade_,2022-06-02,Tandem Pump Question - Pump Reset Alarm? I think pump just reset on me in the night.,"I woke up in the middle of the night with my pump telling me it was out of insulin and to change the cartridge. This was unexpected as I had gone to bed with plenty of insulin in the pump! My blood sugars were also not showing on the pump even though my Dexcom was on and otherwise working (my phone was still receiving data).

In a haze, I changed my cartridge. I checked the old cartridge (afraid that my pump had somehow given me all the insulin left in my pump at once!) and fortunately that didn't happen, I still had a bunch of insulin left in the old cartridge.

I went back in my pump alert history and it says I have an alert called, ""Pump Reset Alert 3"". Has anyone else ever had this? Any idea what causes it?? I am so confused, I've only been asleep for an hour and half, this alert went off within fifteen minutes of me falling asleep (and it clearly didn't alarm very loud since it took me over an hour to wake up...).

I'm assuming I haven't been getting any basal insulin for the last hour and half and now I feel queasy, although I'm hoping it's just mentally induced from my anxiety. My blood sugar is 99 and I think an hour and a half without insulin is not enough to get me into a ketone state (I hope).

So rather than looking for fun accessories for my hot new set of wheels, I'm looking for ways to manage my new kit. So far so basic, just a pair of insulin pens, a Onetouch Vario glucometer, various pokes and test strips. Really just the day-to-day stuff.

I've always worn a belt and used to like to wear my cell phone on a belt clip, back before they all had easily scratched screens. I've started doing something similar with my pancreatic replacement kit using a binoculars bag and a utility knife bag. I'd like compartments and an insulated area, though.

Do any of you know of a bag that would fit that bill? I'm thinking it should be slightly longer than an insulin pen, slightly wider than a glucometer and lancet, and maybe a little storage block for the sharps.

Our first stay is near a Tesco so well just pop in there to stock up on a few basics to have with us.

Q1  Ill come with plenty of emergency glucose tabs, but what are your favorite local low snacks? Candies, chips (crisps), whatever brings you back up and also is mildly nice to eat!

Q2  Any favorite hiking snacks you get there? I usually pack some granola bars, meat sticks, carrots, and a sandwich before heading out on a hike. But am open to anything you guys have and recommend!

Q3  It looks like Tesco has Splenda so Ill grab some and bring it around with me just in case. Any tips on other things I might need to grab when Im in larger towns/cities that small country areas wont have?

Q4  What do you guys do with sharps? At home I clip the needles and then am allowed to toss the rest in with the regular garbage (pen needles, not syringes). Is that okay there or do I need to get an official sharps container to bring with me?

Those are the only specifics I can really think of right now, but welcome any other local T1 tips you want to share! Ill be well stocked with med supplies for the month, so Ill be over-prepared on that front :-).

Noize42,2022-05-26,CGM Coverage in Ontario through ADP or Private Insurance,"For those of us living in Ontario, have you been affected by the provincial government's decision to cover Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGM) like Dexcom or Medtronic through the Assistive Devices Program (ADP)?

I have been fortunate enough to have my Dexcom covered since January 2021 through my workplace health insurance, however it looks like they may not continue covering due to the recent announcement that it will be covered through ADP. The ADP eligibility criteria are extremely restrictive to anyone carefully managing their diabetes, especially those who are already using this technology successfully. 

 To receive ADP coverage, you must meet the following eligibility criteria for program benefits. 

1. Applicant has type 1 diabetes. 

2. Applicant meets one of the following. 

a) Applicant is unable to recognize or communicate symptoms of hypoglycemia, or independently perform fingerstick glucose testing, owing to their developmental stage or a previously diagnosed cognitive or physical impairment. 

b) Applicant had severe hypoglycemia in the past 2 years without an obvious precipitant, despite optimized use of insulin therapy and glucose monitoring (at least 4 times/day) which result in one of the following: I. suspension of the applicants driving licence; II. hospitalization or emergency room or EMS visit; or III. glucagon administration, unconsciousness, or seizure.

bricee1107,2022-06-18,Husband with diabetes,"Hi all,

I am hoping someone can give me advice as a spouse of someone with type 1 diabetes.

Some back story, my husband wasnt diagnosed with type 1 diabetes until last year at the age of 25 after being dka when having Covid. 
After that incident he did really well with his insulin and tracking his blood sugar for about 4 months, after that he told me that he felt like could control it through excersize and he didnt want to take it because he gained weight from it and he kept getting low blood sugar. I told him I supported his decision as long as he monitored it and he took insulin when he needed.

Fast forward to earlier this month- my husband was dka again. I tried to get him to go to the ER many times and he refused. He becomes very hostile and mean When he hits these levels (granted its only been twice but the signs and experience has been the same as someone with an outside perspective)
He got out of the hospital and I tried to talk to him again about his insulin and monitoring it and he blows me off. Anytime I ask him about his blood sugar he has no clue what its at and will just take insulin. 

We have a daughter together and everyday I feel stressed out about something happening and I cant ask him or he gets mad so I dont know what to do. Im not stranger to blood sugar mood swings, as I have pcos. Granted its not the same but has its own set of difficulties.

Im hoping someone on this pge can give me some insight on what I should do, and frankly be honest with me if I am in the wrong or how I can navigate this without feeling like Im bagging.

Hey Redditors! Its my first participation on here, and definitely not my last as I will probably nest here lol. My mother was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes 9 months ago - Im pretty sure she had it for a long time before, but she never cared for her own health enough to check up on herself. Anyways, I have been assisting her along with my sister and keeping track of everything with her. She is used to it but she unfortunately still doesnt know how to keep it from extremely fluctuating. As a result, she is constantly agitated, confused, angry (so angry), and squinting (partially closing her eyes to see.) Now we fixed some of the problems gradually, but others remain, especually that we are under constant extreme pressure. We are on a roller-coaster right now with a bunch of hard decisions being made on a daily basis. So basically constant hardship pressuring her. We found out she had diabetes when we tested her at the hospital. Her A1C was 11, and her BG at the time was +500. Also she constantly faces low BG, because she is tired of the constant trauma and fear of sugar. Please give me your suggestions on this, and also what candy do you suggest she keep around for when the BG is low.",6,1,39

I asked a similar question last year in this subreddit with regard to how customs/security at the airport deal with diabetics and the supplies you have to bring (insulin, needles, devices, etc.) but got the most replies from people who have a Dexcom, T-slim x2, etc. and while that was interesting to read, it is not really the answer I was looking for since I use the Omnipod Dash &amp; Freestyle Libre. 

So, Im asking you all (Freestyle Libre and/or  (preferably and) Omnipod Dash users) again; is it allowed to go through the metal detectors (just a regular one, nothing fancy) with your Freestyle Libre and Omnipod on your body, or will it damage the devices and should I ask for a pat down? + do my supplies (the Freestyle Libre scanner, the sensors, insulin, extra pods, the Omnipod Dash device/mobile phone looking thingy) need to be hand searched or are they save to go through the bag scanner (I believe its X-ray)? 

My endo is a very passive lady who has never really been there for me so I cant ask her + the answers on the internet are so& different from each other, so that is why Im asking you guys who probably have had experience with this, feels a bit more safe and I trust yall :)

PanicInSanFrancisco,2022-06-11,Help needed: receiving insulin pump in Netherlands (urgent)," 

Hello! I'm sorry if this is a very specific question and I'm not sure if anyone will be able to help, but I thought it would be worth a try.

I am from the United States but am currently studying in the Netherlands until mid-August. My insulin pump has recently been malfunctioning, which has made it very difficult to control my blood sugar. Through my (American) supplier and insurance I was able to order a replacement pump. However, the company will not ship outside of the USA. I had the pump sent to my parents back home, but now the issue is how I can receive it here.

From previous experience it seems that I need a special license or something in order to receive shipments that contain medical equipment. A few months ago, my parents tried to send me some extra diabetes supplies but the shipment was sent back for this reason. They cannot afford to fly here and bring me the pump. So now I am a bit stuck because I really need the new pump as soon as possible, but I do not know how I can receive it. Does anyone know if the rest of the EU has this same policy? If not, I have a few friends in Belgium, Germany, and Italy and was thinking I could have it shipped to one of them and travel to pick it up. Or would my Netherlands GP be able to receive it? Or is there a quick way to get this license?

Apologies for the long post, but I am a bit concerned for my health if I am not able to figure this out quickly. I appreciate any help, and thank you.",3,0.81,2

I woke up at 5 AM at 119, bolused the same amount for breakfast as I always did with Medtronic, waited 30 minutes, and my sugar continued to rise until it hit about 304.  I changed the site and cartridge, went for a 17 minute walk, checked again, and was still 304 by finger stick (CGM had been warming up and when it came back it said it was 313).

I was diagnosed with late-onset T1D yesterday, at 27 years old, and 19+3  weeks pregnant. I had gone into what was supposed to be a gender-confirming ultrasound on Friday last week, but was told that my OB's office accidentally booked it as a regular appointment. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise because they found sugar spill-over in my urine, and my BG pricked at 451. 

A1-C labs came back for 8.9 over the last 90 days, which led them to rule out Gestational Diabetes. My doctor called yesterday to have me admitted to the hospital, so I've been here since last night. They gave me both long and short acting insulin, and I got down to a 77 after dinner! Woke up to a 130 after fasting. 

They're keeping me here until tonight or tomorrow, most likely, and I am not sure what all I need to know before I leave. This was totally unexpected and shocking to me - I failed to ask any questions at my OB on Friday, and I don't want to miss anything before I leave the care of people who actually know what they're doing here at the hospital.

Jonny_Icon,2022-06-04,Dexcom G6 vs Libre 2 experience,"I was telling my endo office of my frustration with Dexcom the past eight months, and the frequent alarms that say Im low when Im not (7% of readings below 70), and suggested trying a Libre 2 to see if thats any better. A few observations after a few days:

Dexcom for me is usually reading 20-60 points lower than meter check when readings stabilize, meanwhile Libre 2 is the exact opposite. 20-60 above what meter shows. 

It seems the Libre 2 also tends to exaggerate the higher numbers the further readings climb. I havent been above 180 according to Dexcom in a half year, yet Libre 2 this morning was at 250 while Dexcom read 140. 

I dunno& the Dexcom at least has ability at times when sugars are stable to attempt to calibrate, and nice to always see readings on my wrist or car dash. Libre 2 has been a bigger frustration so far. Inability to always see my reading without scan, and lack of calibration is a big turn off, despite a reprieve from false low readings.

A few minutes later my arm feels ok, still a little sore where the sensor is, but I can move it freely.

mellyyclaire,2022-06-03,better blood sugar control and weight gain,"In the past, I've purposefully kept my blood sugars on the higher side due to extreme hypoglycemic anxiety. Over the last year, I've given myself a kick in the butt and really put getting my diabetes in better control a priority and I've come a long way. Over the year, on average I'd be about 60% in range and then now in the last month, have been pretty consistently 90% in range (give or take). I've always been a very active and very fit person and even more so over the last month and yet I feel like I've rapidly been gaining weight especially in my mid section (stomach, love handles, upper thighs). I've read how insulin can be related to weight gain but with being more in range and eating healthier and exercising, I'd say I'm using less insulin than when I ran higher.

donutupsidedown,2022-06-03,Humulin 70/30 big swings,"Hi! I am only two weeks in to my T1D diagnosis, and let first say, thank you so much to everyone in this community for the helpful tips and support! I have picked up so much knowledge in just my short time in this club!

Onto my question (and this will probably turn into a little bit of a frustrating vent so thanks for bearing with me). 

My endo seems to be an old school doc. He has me on Humulin 70/30, twice daily, injections are before breakfast and before dinner. 

I am noticing huge swings in my blood sugar. I am remaining in tight control of my diet, working on a whole foods, plant based diet with special attention to staying on the low glycemic foods and adding in nuts, avocado, seeds, etc to ease the spikes. I have also been remaining active/exercising daily. 

Obviously, I am brand new to this and still tweaking insulin amount, timing, and diet (and logging everything)! But i wanted to see if there is any advice for working with Humulin 70/30? 

As I learn more and more, Im wondering if I should start asking my doc about basal/bolus injections, as i feel the Humulin doesnt quite stretch as far as I need for a basal effect, and I dont have much bolus control while being on the Humulin 70/30. 

Is this typical of a newly diagnosed paitient? Im assuming we are starting on this prescription to build a foundation of data?

My endo has also made statements that a CGM isnt neccessary and that I should stick to his diet of meat with every meal to control blood sugar (though Id rather try to stay as plant based as possible since that was my diet before my diagnosis). Hence, im a tad frustrated that we are not in agreement on how to manage. I feel he is an old school doc who distrusts technology and feels plant based is a fad diet. 

I have another appt in a couple weeks where Ill ask many questions now that i have more data on my blood sugar. 

I also have an appt with a different endo, to get another docs opinion. 

Any advice/words of wisdom?

I'm taking off work to stay home with her during the summer so we can focus on getting her back to being independent again. She's 11. 

I have sick leave but it will be a significant pay cut. So anything I can do get through the next two months will be a huge help. 

I've already put my car payment into forbearance (CarMax was really great about it btw). 

I tried the same with my Mortgage but they were not so helpful (Pennymac... Never been a fan since they bought my loan). I spent two hours answering questions just so that they can send me an application, and once the application is approved I'll be presented with options of a loan modification. I plan to see what the options are but I'm not optimistic that they will be good options. They will most likely change my rate (currently 3.6) and modifications can negatively affect credit. They seem to have a really hard time getting passed the fact that I do not have an issue with paying the loan, I'm only asking for 1 or 2 month forbearance until I return to work. It's not like I can't manage the payment, it's that I have an unforseen situation in which my dependent needs extra care temporarily. Yet all of their answers to my questions were somewhere along the lines of wanting to make my payment more affordable so that I don't risk a foreclosure. I don't need a lower payment. It's already affordable. I just need one very short pauae. But even after two hours, they still couldn't tell me exactly what they can offer.

Yesterdays labs revealed high chloresterol. The nurse called today to say the endo prescribed me Lipitor. 

Im all for listening to my doc, but I have concerns about throwing pills at the chloresterol right off the bat. Is it possible that as I get my blood sugars under control with diet and exercise, my chloresterol will follow? Id rather try the route of diet/exercise first.

noturmothersmilkers,2022-05-27,CGM Data Anxiety &amp; General T1D Anxiety  Help!,"Hi everyone! This is my first post here and I'm sure there's many similar to mine, but I'm reeeally struggling. I've been a T1D for a little over 15 years now (yay?) and one of my BIGGEST fears has always been low blood sugars. I don't know when this happened specifically as I've never had such a severe low that's required medical attention or assistance beyond just asking someone to grab me a juice box. Either way, it's very crippling and makes it difficult for me to do virtually anything in a day without worrying irrationally that I'll just plummet at any point without warning and for no reason.

As I'm sure you can imagine, my A1C and time in range is suboptimal, to put it lightly, though some days are better than others. I'm currently using an old Medtronic pump, which works fine, but I'm actually starting on the Omnipod tomorrow! I'm also using a Dexcom G6 as my CGM, which has been working relatively well, BUT also causes me a lot of anxiety. Basically any time I see something that doesn't ""sit right with me"", like a fluctuation I couldn't predict, or a blood sugar dropping more than I anticipated; honestly any change at all, I panic. To me, having a CGM has been a blessing and a curse wrapped into one. On the one hand, there's a sense of calm that I'll be notified if my blood sugar goes low (even though the alert itself would trigger an instant panic attack), but having access to all this data is insanely overwhelming and I have micromanaging tendencies/watch the graph almost constantly throughout the day. The arrows straight-up freak me out, specifically ones trending down in any capacity. To give you an idea, most people would love for a high blood sugar to drop down to a normal level, but for me I had big and fast drops, especially hours after I've taken insulin and I think ""it should be out of my system, why am I dropping?""

I'm Canadian, so I go by mmol, but essentially anything in the single digits make me nervous, which as you can imagine, makes it harder to manage. I will say that I've managed to bring my A1C down from a 10-something to an 8.6 which I know isn't ideal, but I was happy I somehow managed to bring it down despite my ridiculously high level of fear. I don't LIKE single digit numbers, but I do feel okay around the 8-10 (144-180) range and I'll correct for levels above 12 (216), but I worry that I won't be able to progress much further though because I just can't get over that hurdle of fear. In my mind anything under a 7 (126) is too close to a 4 (72) and mentally difficult for me to bear.

If anyone's ever dealt with this and overcome their anxiety, please share your tips with me! I'm so desperate at this point, every day I'm just a depressed and anxious mess. I love/fear and obsess over CGM data simultaneously, and I'm extremely afraid of low blood sugars. I'm also sorry if this has been discussed already, but I'm so desperate for some help, all I do is cry every day. I feel so alone and trapped in my body and feel like I'm doomed to suffer from complications, which thankfully I haven't yet. People in my life are supportive, but they can't stop me from being anxious unfortunately. Any help is welcome!",5,0.86,11

OnyxWebb,2022-05-26,Somogyi effect?,"Has anyone experienced/come across this before?

For years I did basal at night, around 11.30pm, then noticed that I always wake up hypo - count could go from 11.7 (210ish) right down to 2 (36) overnight.

I reduced my basal by 2 units, from 14 to 12. Same issue. 12 to 10, same issue. Then my diabetes team told me to split my basal, 2 units at night, 6 in the morning.

This seemed to stop the night hypos for a couple of days, but for the past week I'm hypoing during the night, from 8ish BG to below 3, but rarely do I wake up because 30 mins later I can see in my libre app that my BG shoots straight up to double figures (11ish again). This combined with dawn phenomenon makes it incredibly hard for me to get my levels down, and it takes until dinnertime sometimes for them to level out.

This new increase in BG in the morning isn't dawn phenomenon btw, as it's happening while I'm alseep, about 4-5 hours before I wake up.

I'm now down to 8 units of basal a day and decided to solely inject this in the morning to see if it will stop the night hypos and rebounding.

pujit55,2022-05-25,Intermittent fasting experiences,"Have a question for the T1D folks here, as I know that some have done intermittent fasting before. 

Quick background in case any of these help inform an answer: 32M, diabetic since age 7, former college athlete, remain active (basketball + weightlifting 4-5 days per week) despite working from home now 100% of the time. Using dexcom g6 and tandem pump, A1Cs have been in the upper 5s for the last few years (thanks to my CGM and being a constant tinkerer).

I typically fast for 16 hours on weekdays. It helps keep my weight in a healthy spot, prevents me from eating more than I should while I work from home, and generally makes me feel great. My sugars are also extremely level, in range almost 100% of the time for 12-14 hrs straight, while Im fasting. 

However - as soon as I have any carbs, no matter how early I bolus or how I adjust my basals, my sugar shoots up and does not want to come down. 

Ill go to the gym, shoot hard to get my heart rate up, then lift (all with pump on), and will typically drop quickly. But as soon as Im done, my sugar will rise almost instantly and continue to hover above target until later on in the evening. I would say this happens often from 12p-6p.

Duckbird88,2022-05-20,Sanity Check for choosing HDHP vs EPO Plan Insurance at New Job for T1D costs,"Hi all,

My partner accepted a new job and is about to elect benefits. We determined it makes sense for us to maintain our separate health insurances and we have analyzed the new plans available to her. 6 plans were available and we narrowed it down to the 2 below.

So far, it seems like the HDHP is the clear winner which is surprising. This is her first time working at a job with not great insurance so I would appreciate some feedback if we are missing any unforeseen issues or costs that may not be readily apparent? Fortunately, we are in a place where we can afford the yearly up-front out of pocket costs.

The HDPH also has a huge advantage with a triple tax-advantaged HSA.

She has called the insurance company multiple times to scope out some more details:

* Dexcom and Pump is covered as DME and not prescription
* Both plans use the same formulary
* Both Summaries of Benefits and Coverage are pretty similar

Are we missing anything? Any reason anyone can think of that may make the HDHP not worth it?

Thank you so much!

HoontarATX,2022-06-11,US Insurance Denials due to Thier Own Mistakes,"
Normally, I am quite the content type 1 diabetic. Not this day though! Health insurance fuckery has really thrown me for a loop. I feel more motivated than ever to chuck some bricks through their windows. Here is my story.

Disclaimer: i am not in danger of running out of supplies. However, these insane delays could put any type 1 who does not have a healthy back-stock at serious risk!! 


My health insurance company spontaneously denied my regular shipment of pump and CGM supplies. ""Request for prior authorization"" denied. Wtf is that? American capitalism, ahhh yes! 

Neither Insurance nor Medical supply company informed me of this denial and shipment delay. Strike 1, dudes. 

Insurance phone support said my supplies were denied because the doctor's notes submitted with my claim were not recent enough. The noted needed to have a date within 6 months of the claim. Ok, lets fix that! Or so I thought.

Called my medical supply company. Informed them they needed to get more up to date doctor's notes and then resubmit the request to insurance. Medical supply staff said their previous request already had Doctors notes that were from last week and went 6 months back. Strike 2, insurance bafoons. 

The medical supply company resubmitted the claim to insurance. Three days pass before I resumed banging my head against this wall of American exceptionalism. 

Called the insurance company again to get status on 2nd claim. They said they never received a 2nd claim. Strike 3, nincompoops. 

Medical supply company verifies they did indeed resubmit the claim and have heard nothing back. Insurance says they need another claim submitted with doctors notes and it would take 3 to 6 days to process. 

This is getting ridiculous, right?

The next day it is time to call both companies at the same time, and mash the phones together so they can speak directly to eachother and hopefully speed things up. Actually had some success with this! Sorta.

 It took nearly two hours of awkward 3-way conversation. This was due to the insurance rep putting us on hold nearly every step of the way. He needed to contact other deoartments for most information that he needed in order to answer relatively simple questions. Regardless,  the medical supply company successfully resubmitted a 3rd claim that the insurance was available to verify they received! Hallelujah 

Wait. Cant celebrate yet because of those pesky doctor's notes.  I ask insurance rep if he could verify whether the doctor's notes came through with that new claim.

On hold for about 20 minutes this time. Longest time yet. When he comes back he says to me ""the department that receives these claim documents is now closed because it is past 5pm. We cannot verify if doctor's notes are received until Monday"". It is currently friday at about 5:05 pm.

What in the actual F, y'all?!? 

Can i sue them for this incompetence?

What do these doctor's notes say, anyways? ""Patient appears to still be alive. Type 1 diabetes treatment still needed."" ???",4,0.67,3

I posted about 2 weeks ago about him running high (250 -380 range). It's happening again, but this time mom didn't send any actual insulin with him, because his pump was just changed before I picked him up. 

I guess I'm gonna run to Walmart when they open, and outright buy some insulin. How does that work? Can I just go buy insulin, or do I need his Rx? I'll also pick up some ketone strips, because he is 400+ now. 

I'm freaking out a bit. 

The pump delivers insulin, it just seems like it doesn't deliver it fast enough. His mother hasn't had any of these problems, and I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. I keep a good eye on him, for any sneaky snacks he might indulge in without telling us. 

I would love some advice if anyone has any experience with this or just some outright wisdom.

Edit/Update: (copy and pasted from my comment, because I'm dumb and couldn't find the edit post option at first.)

Update: I wanted to thank all of you for the advice.

I'm pretty sure we figured it out. On top of the routine disturbance of co-parenting, we think its milk that just keeps him running high. My ex said they use carbmaster milk at home, and my home is a whole milk home. She said that he doesn't drink milk often unless it's in cereal at home, but he will usually ask for more than 1 cup a day at my house. She also said it was probably the milk proteins making him all out of whack.

I learn more and more about his t1d every day, and I hope soon enough, my posts in here will be like the funny stories I see instead of the posts asking for help and advice. I appreciate all of you.",6,1,11

Hello :) just looking for a little bit of advice from anyone who may have had a similar experience to myself with this. I am 25(F) and was diagnosed with my t1D at 21, currently using novorapid with omnipod and freestyle libre 2. I have been overweight my whole life but recently the last couple of years or so Ive put on a fair bit of weight and my BMI is currently teetering on the edge of 40. I have been really struggling to lose weight and my diabetes consultant (endocrinologist) has agreed to let me try metformin to see if it helps reduce my insulin requirements and allow me to lose weight a bit easier. I am not insulin resistant, in fact my total daily doses and ratios are on the lower end of normal so Im not sure how effective the metformin will be with regard to weight loss. 

Has anyone had any experience with metformin as someone with t1d? Worth noting as well that I eat relatively well and go to the gym. I also currently take sertraline for anxiety which has definitely impacted my weight, in that I have put on about 10 lbs since starting it last September.

I created this book because I've had Type 1 for almost 45 years and wanted to give back to the community of people who have helped me get this far. This free book runs as a serialized novel; a chapter comes out via Substack each week. 

I know the struggles we all face when we have a chronic disease. I was diagnosed when I was 13 and went through years of rebellion and denial. 

I wanted to write about the timeline of treatment for diabetes, but in an engaging (I hope) way. My goal is to remind us of how far our treatment options have come, and how new treatment options come to us faster and faster now, thanks to tech.

But I also wanted to acknowledge the emotional struggles diabetes can give us. The book is a fictionalized account of what my diagnosis was like, but it's also a ghost story, of sorts.

I promise it won't be preachy. Things get weird.

Remarkable-Cry3268,2022-06-15,moving abroad...eventually,"Hello all!

My name is Jos<e9>. I have had T1D for 32 years (diagnosed during summer vacation when I was 11) and I am still going strong! Over the past year I switched care teams and was given the opportunity to start using Dexcom G6 and a T:Slim x2. Both of these devices are game changers! I can't believe that I was so adversed to any sort of cgm, pump, or diabetes tech for such a long time. I think it was partly due to the fact that I had an Animas pump when I was in my mid 20's and I really didn't like it at all. My Endo at the time was not the greatest and I never really took the time (or care) to use the device to it's full potential and see what it could do for my control and my life...This is a discussion for another day ha ha. I know I started to get excited about using technology to help control my diabetes when I saw the AccuChek guide me. I know i may sound like an old man here, but a glucose monitor that connects to an app on your phone sounded pretty incredible. I am getting way off track here, but I figured I would start with some personal history since this is my first post. In the next couple of years (hopefully 2 at the most) my wife and I will be moving abroad. Does anyone here have any experience moving to Europe with T1D and continuing to exclusively use Dexcom and Tandem? We will not be moving to England or Spain. I know that makes things harder because those two countries have reps for those two products. The reason I am asking these questions is I know everything else will ""fall into place"" or ""sort itself out"", but that is not an option when it comes to diabetes care. I really do not want to give up the Dexcom and or the T:slim x2 if i can avoid it. I am sure I could try to stay ahead of the game and have a family member mail my supplies out, and in theory that is a great idea, but given the state of things and knowing that if a package gets delayed or lost I would be fucked! The prospect of having to go back to pens or even vials is not a deal breaker, but i have time to try and sort this out and gather as much information as I can, so I would appreciate any feedback or advice you can send my way. If you feel the need to do nothing more than negatively comment on this post or voice a ridiculous opinion please keep it to yourself and move on. Cheers!",6,1,2

Thing is, it serves absolutely no purpose. I've never experienced a single dangerous incident, Im extremely tightly controlled, and not a single medical professional has ever looked at it or cared.

Ive been dealing with low blood sugar for about 9 years now but its gotten worse recently so I finally went to a doctor about it and was officially diagnosed with reactive hypoglycemia.

Im curious because from what I can tell, reactive hypo tends to be a result of something else (gastric bypass, another metabolic immune condition), none of which apply to me, rather than a standalone condition. 

I also regularly see numbers on my CGM that seem high for a non diabetic after I eat anything with more than 40~ carbs (anywhere from 160-200).

AKJangly,2022-05-30,How do I speed up the honeymoon?,"This is a weird one from what I can tell, but I should provide some insight into why I want to kill every last beta cell in my pancreas:

* two days ago, I took absolutely no insulin. No basal. No rapid acting. I kept dropping into the 50s and had one attack that put me into the 40s. Total carbs to keep myself above 70 was 400g. Again that's with no insulin at all. At one point I drank five cans of Mtn Dew in two hours bouncing between 70-140.

That same night I had cake and ice cream before bed and cruised above 200 the entire night. 

All day yesterday I ate low carb and had no issues until after work when I had a can of Mtn Dew. Even then it was fine. Spiked to 140, crashed to 50. Ugh.

Anyways that was yesterday. Today I had a milky way bar at work without insulin, cleared it just fine, but I work hard all day so that's kinda expected.

What's not expected is having an iced coffee after work and watching my blood sugar immediately spike to 300 and plateau without falling. Wasn't my pancreas literally just working? Now I have to correct that.

I've been dealing with this s*** for two years. When does it end?

I am totally okay with full manual control of my blood sugar. Postprandial hypoglycemia runs in my family and T1 diabetes obviously cures that. I've blacked out at work from postprandial hypoglycemia and it's been a revelation getting a CGM to see everything graphed out.

I'm also fine with having full automatic control of my blood sugar. Obviously. I grew up with that.

But what I'm not okay with is having absolutely no insight into what my blood sugar is going to look like 15 minutes from now, making insulin injections potentially deadly and risking severe hyperglycemia if I decide not to risk death. It's a risk to open my mouth to eat dinner. What the actual f***.

It's like playing Russian roulette every time I want to eat carbohydrates, but I burn so much energy at work that I'll pass out without the carbs.

So I really really really need to know: since I can't cure T1 diabetes, how can I quickly kill all of my beta cells so I can actually predict this disease?

photon05,2022-05-22,Anyone know how to *guess* a long-term insulin (Lantus) dose given the 24 hour basal dose from a pump?,"I have a Tandem TSlim pump whose battery keeps doing odd things during random charges and sometimes the pump alerts that it will shut down due to a faulty drop in battery charge (to 5%). A call to the Tandem company resulted in their advise to have a regular pen needle insulin backup in case the pump should fail.  Good advice, except my pump works on short-tern insulin doses (Novolog), and the 24-hour basal rate works out fine for me - I haven't needed to use pen needles in years.  If my pump were to crap out on me when on travel, I can account for Bolus doses using a pen using a 1:1 proximity to how my pump works (using Novolog), but how do I guess my long-term  basal dose to take using Lantus if I don't have use of the pump?

The only downsides for me are that the disconnect has asymmetric top and bottom (so there is only one orientation that it can connect), the adhesive for the needle seems weaker than the disconnect pad, disposing of the needle needs to be done with a sharps container, and as I mentioned it can be a little awkward inserting the needle.

Hey all!

Next Friday, May 27, will be the official launch of CHRONIC on  Substack. Its set up as a serialized graphic novel; a chapter will be  released each Friday. Its free, theres no gimmick. Simply subscribe to  the book and a chapter will come to your email inbox every week.  (Substack is kind of like a blogging platform for writers where they can  independently produce subscription-based work. Some charge a  subscription fee, but many dont.)

Im doing this as a pet project, a way to pay it forward to all the  folks who have helped me with my Type 1 diabetes through the years. Im  hoping that, in turn, the story will help and encourage those who need  it.

The story is fact-based fiction about my experiences when I was  diagnosed as Type 1 when I was 13, back when dirt was new. Who might  want to read it? Readers interested in how diabetics survived before  insulin (or didnt); how diabetes treatment had progressed up to 1977  (when I was diagnosed); indy graphic novel/comics readers; those who  enjoy coming-of-age stories; newly-diagnosed diabetics; those interested  in how to cope with a chronic disease diagnosis.

I hope youll find it funny, and weird, and informative.

For the last couple of weeks Ive been running brief previews of the  book as an introduction to what lies ahead. I hope youll join me on  this journey.

YoYoYoshimura,2022-05-25,A question about 0 carb meals.,"Preface: I am very well controlled. My basals and ratios seem to be totally on point and when I am in my regular work schedule I am 90%+ in range. Weekends can be more of a crap shoot and I can end up with worse control, but Im usually able to keep things pretty tight. 

Edit: forgot to mention. I am MDI so not blousing doesnt mean no insulin. It means no fast acting I would still have whatever is left of my daily lantus in me. 

So, since diagnosis Ive been able to set up totally repeatable patterns of work, eat, sleep that are very easy to maintain. However, sometimes I want to go out to eat on a weekday. Many of the places I eat Have many low to no carb options and I already like these enough to just stick to them. 

Im wondering, if I am going to eat literally 0 carbs. Just sashimi, eggs etc that I do not dose for at home and I know the restaurant does not use hidden sugars or carbs in the prep, am I safe to just not dose? I currently dont dose for protein or fat unless the meal is really heavy in either one. 

Curveball on the end, am I cool to drink alcohol without carbs in me?

My Endo is insistent that I eat carbs at every meal so I will often just eat 2 or 3 gummies and dose 1 unit, but if it isnt completely necessary and it doesnt screw up my health it might be nice now and then to just sit there and eat sashimi without a care in the world.",8,1,13

serenityautumn,2022-05-20,Portion Control Tips,"I have always struggled with overeating and portion control. 

For those with a similar problem, here's a few tips that help significantly: 

1) Downing a decent-sized glass of water before every major meal. Keeps me hydrated and get full faster.

2) When I go out to eat, I ask for a to-go box when I make my order. When the food arrives, I take the excess of the portions and put it into a to-go box at the start of my meal. Out of sight, out of mind. (I'm from Texas, where portion sizes are outrageous. However, that doesn't keep me from finishing my whole meal in one sitting because I can't control myself.) 

3) I make it a habit not to snack on carb/sugar-heavy stuff after 10p on weekdays and 12a on weekends (unless my sugar is low). 

4) When I snack late, I eat cucumbers with lime juice, lime beer salt, and often Chamoy sauce (I'm Latina, lol). No carbs/sugar in any of those things, and the Chamoy is SUPER flavorful. Some people also add tajin or other chili powders.

Super cheap ingredients (a large bottle of Chamoy is less than $2 here in south TX, and cucumbers are all water, pretty much).

Of course, be wary of salt intake. And too much Chamoy/tajin can be bad for your teeth and stomach. (Trust me though, you won't need a lot of it!)

Spuds4Duds,2022-06-16,Been an interesting few months.,"Started having searing arm pain mostly in my left arm and shoulder with numbness and tingling in the thumb and 2 adjacent fingers but also  in my right thumb and 2 fingers if I moved my head just right. And was becoming very clumsy and was dropping stuff.

Was referred to a Spine and pain clinic where an MRI showed a bulging disc between c3/c4 and arthritis and spurs and narrowing between c4/c5 and c6/c7. One of the things that can happen I suppose from being in your late 60's.  Have been having numbness problems while sleeping for a couple years and kept trying to find the right pillow or position to solve it .They said it was late stage 2 and moving towards stage 3.

So a steroid injection was proposed and done. WOW did that hammer my blood sugar, first in time years I went over 400 and was consistently over 200 the first few days. It was a bit uncomfortable at first but way less painful than the steroid shot I had years back in my right ankle. And seemed to help.

Therapy was prescribed and seemed to only make it worse so was stopped after a few weeks when I went to the Dr. Only thing I got out of it was do not turn your head to the left and lower it or your arm will go limp. The Dr. then prescribed neurontin ramping up to 500mg 3 time a day.  

I noticed it too seems to raise blood sugar levels a bit, maybe 30/40 points. But worse it removed the ability to detect lows.  I went low one night and the reader went off I looked at it and saw 57 with a down arrow. I felt nothing wrong and before this was low sensitive so I figured it was a compression low and went back to sleep. Shortly after it again went off and waking I noticed I was again sleeping with the arm under me. So I turned the reader off and took it out of the room since it will still alarm if below I think 60 when off.

Bad mistake, woke a bit later feeling really off and getting out of bed ended up on the floor and had to pull myself back up.   I staggered out of the room and turned the reader on and was greeted by LO.

Checking with a test trip showed 22 so oops the reader was right. I stole one of the wife's iced teas from the frig and washed down 4 glucotabs. Noticed when I had turned the lights on my vision was off, sparkles and silver. My wife came out and picked up all the test strips dumped when I attempted to open the container.

After some time the readings climbed back over 70 so we went back to bed and I left the reader on and next to the bed again .

Ramped back down on the neurontin and stopped taking it and told the Dr. about what happened. They agreed that stopping it was best. And set up another appointment for an injection. 

Had it yesterday and the rise in blood sugar is starting again. But the pain is going down and I can hold my head more upright again so it was worth it. And I seem to have my low detection again as the alarm went off the other day and I felt it when I woke.

Living in Florida the chances they will prescribe pain medications are nil so I have to hope this eventually solves it. Not real sure I would take them anyway as I remember years back when I had Abdominal surgery the pain killers removed low detection. They are sending me to another therapist that they said is more suited for the therapy needed.

Thought I'd post to remind anyone if they are having numbness or pain similar to mine to not ignore it. He said it's common most do not seek treatment until the pain starts. But it would have been easier to treat if I had started early. They are trying this first but did mention surgery may be required to treat it.",8,1,4

They're mostly leaks, and I don't recall ever having a leak before this period. It doesn't matter where I put the pods on my body.

I started a spreadsheet to keep track of everything for reporting to Omnipod. Looking at my spreadsheet, between 4/12/22 and 6/12/22, I had 16 failures, 10 of which were leaks. During that time, if the pods had functioned properly, I should have used 21.

dogsandnumbers,2022-06-11,New Job = 10 hours on the phone with insurance,"Warning: long post

US based (obviously) and I know that I am incredibly privileged to have insurance through my work. Nevertheless...

I was on student insurance for the past 5 years getting my degree. I graduated in early May and was fortunate enough to have a job lined up to start at the end of May. So I was only without insurance for about 3 weeks while my husband and I moved 2000 miles cross country. 

The stress started early. My previous insurance ended May 9th. My dexcom reorder wasn't eligible until May 15th. So I got a free sample from my Endo and figured I'd stretch the 3 sensors out as long as possible. 

First day of work (2 weeks ago) I submit my benefits enrollment and was told I'd be covered by the end of the week. Woohoo! Especially since my insulin is dwindling. 

Monday (this week) I get my new insurance card (yay!) And covid (boo!). I was able to get a script for paxlovid but for about 3 hours there I was worried I'd have covid, no insurance, and no insulin. 

Luckily I'm feeling pretty good so I could spend all of Tuesday trying to get an insulin script to my new pharmacy from my old Endo, my old pharmacy, or my new PCP. 

Wednesday insulin is ready for pick up (thank God). I also put in my last sensor. I spend the day sorting out DME. On past insurance my deductible was $1500 and 20% coinsurance. On new insurance it's $300 and 10% (woohoo!). I call to see if I can order direct or have to go through a supplier. Supplier. Edgepark. FML. They weren't even sure which pods they had. I call and put in an order. 

Thursday: they call back. I need pre-auths for DME. Also, even though I have a lower coinsurance, it'll be more expensive than my old plan because in addition to edgepark being unsatisfactory they are also expensive. I decide to call my insurance back to see if I was beholden to edgepark. On a whim I check my pharmacy benefits for omnipod Eros and dexcom. Dexcom can go through pharmacy benefits for a fourth the price (woah!). I'll have to stick with edgepark until I upgrade to the 5 in January for my pods but que sera.

So now Ive initiated orders for my dexcom and omnipod, I have a whole months supply of insulin, and I'm not feeling sick at all. What a difference 5 days in strict isolation can make. Also S/O to my husband who's gone to the pharmacy twice in the span of three days and leaves my meals outside the door for me like a very spoiled princess. 

tl;dr my week started out pretty hairy but I at least made the most of my sick leave by spending 10 hours on the phone with health insurance, suppliers, pharmacy benefits, pharmacist, and doctors.",7,1,0

My partner (30M) was diagnosed with T1D at age 9. He has been using insulin pens for many years without issue, has a CGM that he loves, and is about to start a trial period with his very first insulin pump (Tandem) at his provider's urging. The reasoning is that, although his control is decent, it could be better with a pump.

Having just completed his most recent pump education session, he has many reservations about the logistics of wearing and living with this new device.

To those of you who were diagnosed in childhood, didn't mind using pens, and switched to a pump in adulthood:

1. What is it like to live with a pump?
2. What did you have to get used to when you switched?
3. What do you love about your pump?
4. What is the most annoying part of living with a pump?

I finally tested positive for COVID last week, so I thought I would share my experiences with you guys for whatever its worth.  I havent been sick at all since I was diagnosed, much less with COVID, so I was worried about complications with my glucose level and going into DKA. I will preface this by saying I am fully vaccinated (Moderna) with a booster. 

My symptoms started on Tuesday of last week, with a random fever that came out of nowhere. I didnt feel bad, just had chills and a fever for a few hours. Then that went away. 

By Thursday I had a little bit of sinus congestion and my chest felt weird, so I did an at-home test and tested positive. I isolated, and over the weekend my symptoms reached the level of a cold. But that was as bad as it got. 

My blood sugars were in range until Saturday, when my symptoms were at the worst (a cold). Then I started having to bolus 2-3 times my normal fast acting to make a dent. From reading your guys experiences, I expected that being sick I would need to use more insulin to stay in range. 

It is now Friday of the next week, and I am still having to bolus 2-3 times the normal amount of insulin to have any effect. I still tested positive on Wednesday, so I guess my body is still fighting the remnants of the virus even though my symptoms are completely gone.

Mtanga,2022-05-22,Tough to control highs,"Looking for some possible answers here folks. My 5year old daughter has been diagnosed for 3 months. In the beginning it was extreme highs (in the 20's) and sudden lows. We found her diet was the key to close to normal ranges. So we are now eating the low carb way. For a month we gained control, 5.2 -7 with a jump of 2 measurements with a meal. We were feeling we were finally getting there. 

Over the last week however,  we started with a severe drop for no reason that we could see. She had some insulin, not a lot, a single unit to bring her down from a high we saw before she woke up, 3 hours earlier. She was stable at 7, then slowly started to slide 0.2 at a 5 minute interval. While stable at 6 or so, we had an alarm for  double arrows down and she was already on 5.8...finger stick said 3.4 The lowest she got was 1.8 but with glucose powder, juice etc , we got it back up. That day she continued to run high, despite us administering doses of corrections. She just seemed more resistant. The next morning 7am, she woke at 15 and a finger prick showed 18 so we immediately went to bring it down with a correction. As we were setting up, she vommited. Signs of Dka. Keytone strip said 5. So we treated her with the hourly chart and had it down to 10 with no sypmtoms by 10am.

This was the start of a week of highs, not crazy jumps, but hard to bring down. We have not had another low like that. 

For some background info, her teacher has stepped in to give injections while at school, turns out, she has Covid. This all started 3 days after her teacher came back positive. In this week my wife has had a day or two of symptoms,  but is fine now. The rest of us asymptomatic. So we can only assume she may have had it.

Our Doc says she is fighting an infection of some sort and sudden changes are how a Type 1's body will react to them be it flu, colds or a UTI etc. 

A part of me thinks her IR is now adjusting, she just needs more insulin for her foods and maybe a unit or more of the long lasting? 

But something is so off and it's rough to keep giving half units of insulin to her to try bolus her down, knowing it won't do much, but a full unit may take her to a scary low, so it just means more injections.

Last night really confused us as at 10pm she had a high of 14 so we decided let's give 1 unit( I've seen it take her no more than 7 numbers down) and we aim for a target of 7 and if it goes too low we catch it. We'll... it only dropped her to 12 and moved back up too 13 and stayed there. Half units later on did nothing.

In my work I often fix maintenance issues so for me, I need to understand how something works, and with the fault understood, can fix it. This however just seems to keep changing and it's frustrating and I need to get this right for her sake.

I apologize for the long post but maybe someone  has experienced something similar and can help shed some light.

Now when I get low, Ill sometimes get to a point that I can only describe as diabetic psychosis. Ill become super manic, and then just start falling apart getting more and more nuts. I had this happen last night in front of my girlfriend and I realized this is why my last marriage fell apart. I also suffer from depression, and my medications are not working for me. I cant get in to see a psychiatrist to change my medication, my doctor died during the pandemic and my endo is apathetic at best. i want to switch back to dexcom but I know I cannot afford it. 

We have a huge shortage of doctors, so to even get the ball rolling seems like a Herculean task& Im currently on a 5yr wait list. 


I dont know what im trying to accomplish with this post, I guess im hoping to hear that im not alone, and someone understands the feeling and fear that a low like this causes, or has any advice. Im so fucking tired of this.",6,0.88,7
Merkelli,2022-06-16,Is it usual to start treatment this way,"Hi All,

I was diagnosed with type 1 Diabetes about two weeks ago after being admitted to hospital with DKA.

Currently my treatment is to take 10 Units of Lantus in the evening but I was told to take 4 units of Novarapid before each meal, regardless of carbs etc and the endo said not to worry about snacks for the time being. 

Is this usual just to get a baseline for my ratios eventually to adjust doses based on carb intake or is this type of treatment common where you don't adjust for carbs?",6,1,17

I am 35 years old and recently diagnosed with type 1, 3 weeks ago. Found out because my blood sugar was hovering around 550mg/dl and suffering from some major dka. All in all I've had to adjust my diet but I was exercising 5 days a week so it seems like my life hasn't changed much apart from cutting out a lot of carby food.

Anyways... The endo prescribed me with XULTOPHY. It's one shot to be taken in the morning per day and thats it. I've read this is more for diabetes type 2 medication? Also, is any other type 1 out there just getting by with 1 shot per day? I'm asking because on reddit I see so many people discussing bolus shots pre meal etc?

TLDR - What are your Smart Watch recommendations for Dexcom and T:Slim combo? 

Ecosystem does not matter, I can switch between Android and Apple anytime. Just want the smoothest experience possible.

Just had my first experience with a trial Dexcom G6 and aside from adhesive issues, it's been awesome! Was never really a fan of the Medtronic offering and it steered me away from sensors completely for the last 20 years.

That said, I am also in the process of switching over to T:Slim and want to make the most of the technology available for the Dexcom and T:Slim. Which Smart Watch would you guys recommend?

ch3xr0x,2022-06-14,Switching from MDI to Omnipod? Worried that I won't be able to maintain control,"I was diagnosed in December of this year, and have been on MDI since then. I originally was on a combo of Lantus and Humalog, and a couple of months ago switched to Levemir and Humalog. I spent a lot of time fine-tuning my ratios (and obviously still constantly make adjustments), and my most recent a1c was a 5.1. I do think I am still honeymooning, which probably contributes to my good a1c, but I also am putting in a TON of effort. I am planning for pregnancy, which has been a major motivator in figuring out how to keep tight control. The reason my endo switched me to Levemir was because she said that Levemir is the only approved option for long-acting insulin during pregnancy. For the first month+ on Levemir, I was maintaining good control and was very happy with it. Within the last few weeks, however, I seem to have developed some type of allergy (!?) to Levemir. After injecting, I get a rather large raised red bump that is sore to the touch and lasts about three days. This does not happen with my Humalog at all, despite using the same needle length, and I rotate sites every time I inject. From looking online, I found  several forums of people who had the same exact issue develop with Levemir.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, my endo made it clear that Levemir was my only long-acting insulin option (from her perspective) for pregnancy, and that if it doesn't work well for me, I need to switch to the pump. I'm really apprehensive about this because I finally feel confident in my management and I'm so nervous to change something that is working so well! I'm not comfortable with tubing (maybe someday, but having devices attached to me in general is already a big adjustment), so the only pump I want to consider at this moment in time is Omnipod (ideally the 5). My big concern is that I read that you can only set your target for BG on the Omnipod 5 to 110. My target is lower than this (I aim for 90-100) because I am trying to maintain pregnancy numbers. Does this mean that the pump won't work well for me? Or does it mean I would need to use the pump in ""manual mode""? Someone reassure me that going to the pump won't be as hard of an adjustment as I'm expecting!

Axamanss,2022-06-03,Why we need M4A,"Heres a fun story of my adventure to try and fill some needles this morning. 

I order my needles through a mail order supplier as my insurance utilizes them so the 90 day refill is much cheaper than the month to month refill at my local  pharmacy. 

After placing my order last week I was informed that they did not have the stock on hand, but would ship it out as soon as they did. And to call if I was getting low. 

Cue wait time of close to a week. 

I call the mail order supplier to ask about status, as I am now running low. They are super nice and tell me theyll ship it out& until it comes time to place the order when they inform me, once again, they dont have the order in stock and dont know when theyll have it in. And that I should try an seek a different supplier if I need them. 

Great. 

So I call my local pharmacy to have them fill it, its more expensive, but it should tide me over. 

Well the local pharmacy cant fill it because the mail order supplier has (imagine this) already processed the request through my insurance DESPITE not having the order on hand. 

Then I go through this weird back and forth where apparently my local pharmacy couldnt get those pen needles even if they wanted to/they cant do an override with insurance blah blah (this pharmacy is known for being semi incompetent, especially regarding the Dexcom supplies theyve told me repeatedly I couldnt fill with them, yet lo and behold, Im now filling them there). 

So I say okay, let me fill a different needle prescription I have on file and know youll have on hand. 

They say they can give me samples. 

So I guess Im going to go pick up 5 days worth of needles and use generics to tide me over til infinite since the local supplier cant override the insurance request, and the mail supplier cant fill them.

soberjules,2022-05-21,Triplets?! What?!,"Anyone else find out theyre due with triplets? No? Just me? OMG we are so shocked.
At my 8 week 3 day US, the screen had the image up and my husband and I were like& okay what are we looking at? And the tech says, well& theres three. =3=3=3 Baby A had a heartbeat of 187, Baby B was 184, and Baby C was 176. They each appear to have their own amniotic sac and their own placenta.
Needless to say, we were completely and totally shocked and overwhelmed. This is my first pregnancy, it was only our second month of trying, and triplets dont run in either of our families. My dad has cousins who are twins, and one of those twins had twins, so thats probably where the genetic component plays a part.

Im a type 1 diabetic, so already a high-risk pregnancy. Now we have basically quadrupled the risk. Its so strange because Ive been nearly asymptomatic the whole time so far. Ive felt very calm, I dont have a bump yet, Ive really felt wonderful. We are really overwhelmed with the idea of going from 0 to 3 babies, especially because my initial plan was to only have two children.

Now we have started to talk about the very controversial/emotional/difficult topic of procedures such as selective reduction, which I really want to get into more detail with a Maternal Fetal Medicine doctor. We have a lot of questions and I want to make sure that my own health is protected and safe throughout this whole thing, and that the babies are as safe and healthy as I can possibly allow them to be. Ive read that reducing to two can sometimes help to increase the gestational age of the babies and also improve health outcomes for mom. But its also a controversial and heartbreaking decision to think about how you make that choice.

Were also totally freaked out financially. I had always imagined that I would keep my job after maternity leave because we really depend on that income, and the idea of providing for three babies/children all at the same time is totally mind blowing. Fortunately our families live within 10 minutes of our house and both grandmas have already decided that they will stop working themselves and be available for full-time Grandma duty.

Weve been hit with a lot of major news this week and Im definitely still trying to wrap my head around all of it. Has anyone had any similar experiences? Anyone else expecting triplets? Anyone with triplets who has any advice? Definitely trying to feel our way through completely unknown territory at this point, so any input is appreciated.

So Im wondering - how can I be the most supportive sibling possible? I will travel anywhere, pay anything to get him new treatment or enrolled in a trial. I know I sound desperate but hes in a bad place and I hate to watch him suffer. 

Wondering if theres also a support group or therapist anyone would recommend? Hes based in Chicago.",12,0.94,8

KuriHype,2022-05-30,Making New Pump - Prototype,"Running Medtronic 670g with CGM in Auto mode. Saw the omnipod and the some other companies. But they all suck somehow, it does the job but that's it. If you compare pumps with phones it would equal an older Nokia rather then an iPhone. Why is that ?? And even so fucking expensive. Because there is nearly no competition. 

So I thought about Prototyping a new one with some smart minded diabetics. I'm an mechanical student myself. The biggest hurd in bringing a new pump on the market is probably the medical certification and, aswell as the clean production and shipping of accessories. 

Big Goal would be a smart, good lookin high quality pump. With lot of Software customisation. Friendly user interface and clever features. Maybe a cooperation with openAPS? Connectivity to all smart phones and watches as well as possible Software Updates. And all together as cheap as possible. 

Please comment if you have any thoughts, suggestions or critic.

Clean-Goose-894,2022-05-28,Do y'all take insulin for non-starchy vegetables? (and a couple other questions),"I've been a T1 diabetic for a month or so now and I am still learning a lot. However, I live in a very rural area and there aren't any classes that aren't hours away. The classes I have gone to claimed to be for all diabetics, but they were clearly aimed at Type 2s and couldn't answer a lot of my questions. 

Most of my doctors and a couple diabetes educators I've spoken to while I was in the hospital have said that non-starchy vegetables have minimal effects on blood sugar and that I could eat as many of them as I wanted without having to bolus for them. However, I've also had a couple doctors tell me that everything affects blood sugar and should be counted for and bolused for. What do y'all do?

I've also been so worried about keeping my blood sugars under control. How much harder does it get to control them after the honeymoon period? 

How do y'all get ready for exercise and keep yourselves from getting too low?

Right now (as I type this) Im in the PICU with my 3 year old daughter and Im concerned. Shes here for difficulty breathing that developed overnight and when they put in the IV they checked a BMP. Her glucose was 288 at that time. Me being a T1 and a nurse was immediately like hey maybe we should investigate that a little bit? They finally get other labs ordered and they come back, and her blood gases show that shes in metabolic acidosis and her beta hydroxybutyrate is 32 (with 0.2-2.8 being normal and high being an indicator of DKA). The doc here on the PICU unit is now saying that these labs could be off because of other things, even though a finger stick glucose that I requested them to do when they tried to start IV fluids containing dextrose! came back higher at 309, and I shouldnt worry because she doesnt have diabetes, she *just* has respiratory distress. If the labs didnt mean anything diagnostically, then why were they ordered? Do doctors just not want to be the one to tell the parents?

Janathena,2022-05-28,Court and Covid,"I (40F) have been fascinated by other people's experiences as a T1 with covid, so I thought I'd share as I have finally joined the ole' Club Covid, and got to be fortunate enough for it to coincide with jury duty. 

Friday night like a good little diabetic I went and got my second booster shot. I spent the day Saturday in bed recovering from the lovely side effects of moderna. My brother in law stopped by to drop off my son from going out to breakfast with him and I spent maybe two minutes talking to him while grabbing myself a quick cup of coffee before getting back to bed. Apparently that was my first mistake. 

Three hours later we get a text from him. He tested positive. Ok, I think. I barely saw him. It is what it is... We'll see what happens. My big concern though was that I was scheduled for jury duty that Tuesday, and I wasn't sure of their call-out policy. 

Sunday I felt great. I gardened and actually overdid it quite a bit, which is typical. My legs hurt from bending over and I was tired. I took a nap, practically unheard of. I'd say that was the second mistake- waaaay overdoing the garden work so that my soreness accounted at first for my general sense of tiredness.

Monday was great, despite feeling sore. I had just resigned from my job and went to drop off my equipment. I made homemade Lebanese food that night, something I hadn't done in eons (I'm not Lebanese nor do I know anyone who cooks Lebanese food, so I'm self teaching and every step takes forever!). I went full out making several different dishes that night- because why not; I wasn't working anymore. That night I grew even more exhausted... I figured between the gardening and cooking I had overdone it. Still, at the back of my mind was the lingering, ""what if it's covid"" thought. I checked the paperwork for jury duty... No means for calling out for covid, no instructions about what to do if ill. I took a covid test, just in case. Negative. 

Well,... Later that night I started to feel quite unwell. By the time I woke up I knew there was an issue. My blood sugars were ok- I use a dexcom, but I felt like hell. My head hurt. I felt exhausted. My nose was running and I had the start of a cough. But there was no time between calling in to discuss calling out and the time I had to be onsite for jury duty, so I figured I'd just go, talk to someone, and see if I could be recused. I tested again. Negative. I tried to eat my normal egg breakfast but couldn't stomach it.

I get there, and immediately let the coordinator know that I was sick. She was, quite simply, unsympathetic and not letting me leave. She motioned me to a table away from the center of the mass of people, but still a foot away from the last row of chairs. I couldn't believe it- the room was so full of chairs and people that it took 20 minutes just to get everyone in there and seated. There was no good reason to allow a sick person to sit amidst all that in the middle of a pandemic.

I spent the next fours hours in that tightly packed room with three hundred people doing my best to maintain a space cushion, rest my eyes and await a chance to speak with the judge to release me. I cautioned those coming up to my table that I was unwell. They put on masks and said they appreciated me letting them know. One even told me I should let the coordinator know I was sick to see if they'd let me leave... Ha! 

There were two trials- one a three day and one a six day. I went back to the coordinator, reminded her I was unwell.  When they called the groups forward they told us if we were caught in the courtroom with our phones on that they would be taken away and held for a week. That caught my attention as I have my dexcom app on my phone and need it to monitor my sugars. I again approached the coordinator, asked about using the app due to being diabetic, again reminding her that I was sick and alluding to needing special circumstances. I was again told to wait to talk to the judge. 

The whole time I'm waiting I'm keeping my mask on, trying not to cough, thinking about the trekk I've got to make back to the car in this state, frustrated that we are in a pandemic and it's somehow ok to sardine us all in a room without regard to those that are ill,  annoyed that I have to advocate for myself publicly to have my phone and divulge my medical issues to a room of people, and just freaking tired. I wanted to go home and lie down. 

I was released around 1pm. I missed having to serve on either trial, and was one of only a handful of people not selected. I was grateful, but still quite annoyed. I made my way to the car, shuffling like a zombie, which must have been comical since I was well dressed for court. By the time I got home I was done, and dragged myself to bed.

I didn't eat much that day or the next. I think for this reason my blood sugars stayed fairly consistent in the 140s to 160s. When I'd wake up the app was the first thing I'd check. I didn't want to walk it too low especially as the sensitivity that I usually have seemed off and while I use the app alarms I really didn't want them going off consistently while I tried to sleep.  I was terribly thirsty, like I had high blood sugar, but I think that was primarily due to all the mouth breathing from my sinuses clogging.

My head hurt like I had had five vodka tonics the night before and then missed my daily coffee intake. Walking made me out of breath. I'd sit up to eat and would need to lay down soon after and nap. My chest felt tight and it hurt to cough.

Thursday I tested again and it finally returned a positive result, five days after exposure, two days after I was forced to remain in a room with three hundred people while sick. I started feeling better. I could go downstairs and back up ok. 

My appetite started to return. With that however was more blood sugar issues. I got below 70 four different times, each chased by a high. I ate dinner around six and had water for the next few hours. Sleeping at night was uncomfortable after spending a lot of time in bed. I checked my dexcome before turning off the light and it was fine, somewhere in the mid 120s. 

Alarms woke me about thirty minutes later with two double down arrows and a BG reading of 70. I guzzled a juicebox and suspended my pump. I figured I'd play on my phone while I rightsized. 20 minutes later I get more alarm bells. 180 with two double up arrows. OMG. I pull out my tester just to check...yep, confirmed though now 190. 

Seriously. W T F. I'd never seen that quick of a turn around. 

Anyway...here we are today. I'm feeling a lot better. Still having headaches but Tylenol is helping. Getting energy back. I may be able to do some housework tomorrow. My son unfortunately has come down with symptoms as of this morning.... I feel bad. He's boosted and should pull through just fine. I'm waiting to hear the coughs and sneezes from the hubby and my little one which I'm sure are coming.

All in all, I'm glad I had the first  booster (the second I'm sure had no time to help) and the aid of my dexcom. This would have been so scary had I not been vaccinated. 

Oh- and screw jury duty with unsympathetic staff who can't figure out that the pandemic should factor into whether you should be shoving a sick person into a room without elbow room with several hundred people. I really hope I didn't infect people but considering how easily this spreads I feel it unlikely.

Hey all, 

My husband (33) got really sick in late 2019 (possibly covid). He lost a ton of weight and had signs of diabetes. He got on t2 meds, but it wasn't cutting it. For two years we struggled with everything from sickness, terrifying scares, burn out, depression, lack of communication, a failing marrage, etc. The last 6 months of 2021, he was a barely-walking zombie. He couldn't reason, talk, or function.  I was ready for him to die. 

He was correctly diagnosed with t1 in January of 2022. He researched things and got on a regiment. He's on a low carb diet, has a cgm, and is pretty good about keeping in a normal range. He's so much better than he was, but things aren't going well. 

Although things are a thousand times better, he is still having issues. His highs and lows send him into spirals of depression, sickness, and lack of motivation to do anything for days or weeks at a time. He will go months doing little to no work. He is just in pain and feels like shit all of the time. He resembles his ""old"" happy self about 5 days out of the month. 


For example, he has a high that will peak around 200 and hoover around 170/150 for a few hours (sometimes 6 or more hours). He will then have headaches, muscle soreness, joint pain, confusion, etc for 1-3 days. Within that time period, he inevitably has another high or low. Then it just keeps going. I feel like this will never end and we will be stuck in an unending cycle of horrible depression and pain for the rest of our lives. 


I understand therapy/counciling is in order. I am currently the only one making money, and we're barely making it because... well the state of the world. He won't go to therapy because we don't have the money. We could make it happen, but he refuses. 



I came here to rant and cry into my phone. But also to ask your experience with this. I'm trying to understand how much of this could be t1 and how much could be depression/burnout. 

 Is it normal to have a low or high affect you for days, if not weeks?
 How long and severe are the symptoms of a high or low?
Has anyone experience long-term undiagnosed t1 and did that affect your perception of the disease? 
I feel like he may be hyper sensitive to the symptoms because he lived in such a high bg state for so long.

&amp;#x200B;

So here are my stats:

38 year old T1D (30 years) , Tslim, Dexcom

My basal was 97 u day and boluses were about 60u each (I would use mdi for the meal bolus since the reservoir in my tslim is only 300u), if I ate salad with almost no carbs, I would have to give myself like 15 units in order to bring the rise down and Im talking about a basic salad, it was completely stupid.

Waking up would cause my fasting sugar to jump from low 100s to 200s easily without any correction and no meal. (THAT PHENOMENON HAS 99% FUCKED OFF NOW, which is awesome!)

Things were terrible, I felt like shit all the fucking time. Days where I would sit in my bedroom all day and just think fucking terrible defeatist thoughts, contemplating certain fucked options! I hated life, in every single way possible, I fucking hated it.

Every time Id ask my endo about it he said all people are different and its totally fine that Im using stupid amounts of insulin daily.

I hit 305 lbs at my last doctor visit about 3 months ago.. I wanted to die when I saw those numbers, I felt fucking bottom!

One day I fucking lost it, I just went out for a walk, did a mile, then that increased to 3 then 6 then 9, the circuit I do is exactly 3 miles so as my endurance grew I did more, also I have a very addictive personality, which sucks most of the time, but here it actually helped.

TBH I didn't even weigh myself during this because I knew whatever the number would be, would still be shit and knowing how I like to beat myself down, it would have ultimately been counter productive for me to check that early on. I did however notice an increase in my insulin sensitivity, causing me to use less insulin for bolus, during the month that I did my walks, but nothing major, maybe 3-5 units less per meal.

Fast forward a month of that, now summer has come around and as you can imagine, big guys idle hot, so fuck the sun...for now while Im a fat boy, when I reach my end goal of being fit AF, its whoring time, give me all the sun then!

So I did a bit of research on things that can help, Ive done a full 60 day juice fast nonsense before and it helped, no issues with the beetus while doing it.

I wanted to do something different this time though, so I did 2 full days of fasting, on the 3rd day I had some eggs, chicken, and veggies and kept the carb count below 15g. I remember for that meal I gave myself 10 units of Admalog, then 3 more units. That first meal was the last time my bolus has been double digits.

Two more days of this and I will reach the 2 week mark. Heres what has happened to me since I started.

I noticed after the first couple days that I was getting into lows all the time, so I decreased my basal rate from 4.2 u/hr to 2.8 u/hr, this basal rate, without consumption of food, keeps me at 100 mg/dl +/- 10 mg, continuously.

My dry skin, which I attributed to being diabetic, has started to go back to normal, my nose is no longer oily, omg the swelling in my feet + ankles and pitting edema, almost all gone!

Ive gone from 280+ units a day for b+b, to about 80 units total for b+b per day.

My man tits have gone down to what my gf called a strong AA cup to training bra status, this is good, because man.

NO MORE RED/SWOLLEN INSERTION SITES.

Best of all, I always thought I had insane anxiety and ADHD due to terrible ability to focus and just always being in a kind of fog. Come to find out, all the excess insulin was literally fucking with my brain! These conditions are not completely gone but my god has it been reduced greatly!

WTF did I do?

This is starting to sound like an informercial...but its not!

&amp;#x200B;

I do the OMAD (one meal a day diet) with Intermittent Fasting.

These same meals that would have easily been 30 unit meals for me in the past with my shitty Insulin sensitivity are now about 8 units of Admalog. Btw, my meal for the day is usually 4 or 5 eggs, some veggies, meats, and a large salad, some peanut butter, or avocado (about 10 or 15 carbs from the veggies). This type of meal has me entirely satiated for easy 22-26 hours. I seriously dont get hungry during the day. I bought a bunch of junkfood before I decided to start this and its sitting in my pantry right now, the thought of eating that crap gives me anxiety now! Im having friends over tomorrow and Im going to give them all these snacks except for chocolate because Diabeetus!  I also drink a mega shit ton of water during the day, Im talking easy 12 to 15 (16oz) bottles of water a day. I live alone and I go through a Costco 48pk of bottles in about 2.5 days.

I have NOT had the need to correct a low yet since I started with my reduced basal rate, my sugars dropped lowest to 60 due to a busy day walking around at work etc, but it hovered there then went back up to 80s not long after. Again this was without anything being consumed since I wanted to stay in the autophagy stage of the fast.

I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO NOT CORRECT A LOW, I was aware of the risks and had my tslim on my desk where I could keep an eye on it while I was working, If I fell into the 50s it would be immediate glucose tab, but since I didn't, there was no need at that time.

BTW my boner power is like 25 year old levels again! just sayin.

I usually eat around 8pm each day, once you hit 18 hours of a fast your body goes into autophagy which is your body essentially recycling dead or damaged cells and replacing with new ones. As a betic-cyborg, that is important to me, so I stretch it out as long as I can, sometimes I'll even skip the dinner meal and do a lunch on the following day so 40hrs total fast with a good 22 hrs in that autophagy stage, and its not because I'm trying to lose additional weight, which I am, but Im just seriously not hungry.

Heres the greatest part for me, Im 5'10"" I went from 305 lbs a couple months ago, to 251 lbs as of this morning, my goal is to say fuck you to the number 2 and hit the 199 lbs and lower club, after 20 years of fantasizing about it like a little bitch, Ive finally committed.

I hired a personal trainer, once I start with him on the 20th, Im going to go to probably more like 2 meals a day inside a 4 hr window, keep the 20hr fast in place and increase the carbs and calories of those two meals, which will be tough as hell, I never thought in my 38 years Id say that I would have trouble finishing a meal. What Im trying to get at if anyone is still reading, is that Intermittent fasting dramatically decreased my insulin resistance, my weight, and increased overall health to the point where I can actually push myself and work out without getting hurt, to see this bitch through.

I know most people here already know this, but for those who do not. Insulin prevents the breakdown and burning of stored fat, high levels of fat increases insulin resistance, which requires more insulin, which causes more fat storage, which increases your resistance, and it keeps going like this until you die or decide to finally do something about it.

Now, IF isnt the only option, I say do what works for YOU,  take it from a 30 year betic, make SOME change, whether its lifestyle or diet, do it and dont fucking half ass it! Any of those will help with the resistance and increasing your overall physical and mental health; the diet though is a lot easier to do in the beginning than a shit ton of exercise, especially if you weigh a lot like I did, dont get me wrong, I'm still fat at 251 but much much better than before!

GORILLAZ_FAN_606,2022-06-18,"Is insulin actually a ""poison"" for us, diabetics?","About a 2-3 weeks ago I went to the endocrine and she said that my values were really bad (Which actually, yes, they were bad. I was under pressure because of final exams, my period and I was having a lot of low for not sleeping well + my endocrine changing my slow-acting insulin, but overall they werent that bad, only a few days the values were unstable, but nothing that bad). 

She blamed me and said that I was hurting myself by using insulin, that I should have the perfect values so I could put less bolus. She also said that was all my fault by not changing my diet (days before meeting the endocrine, she said that I should go to the nutritionist, and the nutritionist said that my diet was good, only that I should stop eating so much bread which I refused because thats the only fast thing I can do in the morning to go early at school). 

I was confused, it was the first time I have ever hear such a thing, she said that insulin is a poison for me, and that it could kill me in long term?! But isn't insulin what is keeping me alive and keeping my values right?! Is it actually all my fault by not eating well, or is she just crazy??? 

In any case, I decided to go back to get checked at a different place where I used to go before, they're more away from home and I'll get late go school some days, but I wanted to check in another place to know if it is right that I'm doing the wrong thing, or if that nurse was the wrong one... But my next checking will be in 2 weeks, so I wanted to know from you all, T1D, was the nurse right? Is it actually a poison for us?

Chrizthewizard,2022-06-01,Thoughts?,"25 year old male here. Diagnosed type 1 January of this year after months of rapid weight loss and feeling like general shit. I was going back through pictures to try and see if I could pinpoint the moment when I became diabetic. For reference, I got ACL surgery late September and COVID  early October. Ive seen that viruses and environmental factors can cause one to develop the dormant gene and was wondering if anybody had something similar happen? Like if they got COVID and then a type 1 diagnosis. 

The shitty thing is that I was actively trying to be healthier. Eating cleaner, drinking a lot of water, and exercising. So when I was dropping 5 pounds a week and drinking 3 gallons of water a day I was like damn Im so efficient, must be superhuman. Those thoughts changed when I weighed less than when I was 14yo, when I could not for the love of god hold a piss in, when I would come home after work and completely pass out without even making an effort to spend time with my son. Or when my wife told me that I was distant and always upset and disinterested in being with her. Or when everybody would ask me if I was doing drugs.
Anyways, my mother convinced me to go to the ER. Sugar was 460+, A1C was 12.9. 
All good now, still figuring things out but Im healthier, happier, and feel normal again. 

Sorry for the soliloquy, but still curious; anybody get COVID and then type 1?",20,1,16

First, thanks to everyone in the community who chipped in with advice. I really appreciate the support. You really helped out!

Second, we tried the Steel 90 site. He was very hesitant to use the needle because he had convinced himself that it would be more painful than the soft catheter. I told him about the comments from the group, and he agreed to try one. To say he was amazed at how little it hurt would be an understatement. He is now 100% on the Steel 90 train!

We had just ordered a new batch of supplies that arrived last week. I figured we'd have to eat the cost of replacing the Autosoft 30s we'd just paid for. Nope! Tandem accepts exchanges of unopened boxes of supplies! So, this week we should have our new sites in hand, and I should have a healthier kid.

nominanescio,2022-06-04,Someone told me to cure my t1 with breathing and it felt super invalidating and bad,"Hi y'all, I just really needed to vent to other T1s because I'm having a rough time at it right now, and maybe y'all can sympathise. 

Ok so a little backstory I guess. I got diagnosed (age 25) in april 2021, was in DKA with a weeklong ICU admission+hospital stay, the whole shebang. 
It's taken a lot of effort and pain and therapy to get to a point where after a bit over a year, I've kinda come to terms with my diagnosis, processing it in a healthy way and keeping ICU-induced ptsd at bay. These days I have decent control over my blood sugars, i'm exercising more and more, starting to live my life like I want to and working diabetes into that, instead of letting diabetes guide my life. 
It's been really hard but I'm managing and I'm proud of how far I've come. 

And now today, at my weekly sports club training, someone I've talked to a few times before, noticed me using my pens and started chatting to me about diabetes. I don't mind talking about it so I just said ""yeah it's a lot to deal with but I've figured out a routine now so i'm managing"" etcetc. 
Then she goes off on a thing about some kind of breathing exercises that'll cure it and I'm just there like. Um. no. That's not how this works, i don't have the cells left to make insulin. But she was very insistent and convinced of it. That our bodies are ""capable of way more than people know"", and that because i once did have the insulin making capabilities, it could be reversed with this breathing stuff...
I managed to stay civil and just end the interaction with a ""no thanks but i'll find you if i wanna know more"" but felt so weird and taken aback by the conversation, but couldn't pinpoint why. 

On the bus ride home I started figuring out why it felt so insulting and invalidating and all the doubts and anger and sadness that I felt at the start of my diagnosis came flooding back and now I'm just stuck here in that mindspace again. 
As if it's my fault and my failure for getting diabetes, as if I should try harder and then I could be ""cured"", as if I'm doing this to myself and can choose to not have this disease. As if I'm weak for having this happen to me. 

I've seen and enjoyed the various cinnamon memes on here, but this was my first time experiencing something like it first hand and I'm having a hard time dealing with it. 
Accepting my diagnosis required a lot from me and it's so frustrating seeing all that progress vanish so quickly, from a simple conversation like that. 

I don't know. 
I can talk to my partner and my friends but none of them have t1 so they can listen and comfort but don't truly understand what it's like. 
I'm hoping at least one you gets what I'm going through right now and can tell me it'll get easier to deal with this shit, or at least that i'm not alone in it. 

And thanks for reading this far. It helps to vent and feel seen, and I appreciate this subreddit for providing a space for us.",164,0.98,80

cutebutslow,2022-06-18,Discrimination at work,"I feel very sad because of an incident that happened at work last week and I need to rant. I want to hear your opinions on that, so please let me know what you think. 

I am a university student and I also work at a bakery outside of my student life. 
My job is physically exhausting, were standing, walking and carrying stuff around all the time. I often get low alarms at work, so I quickly eat some glucose tablets and go on with work. My boss and all my coworkers know about my t1d, that when Im low I sometimes have to take a break to treat it and recover and they seem to be supportive and understanding, at least thats what I thought.

When I experience a more serious low with shakiness, weakness, being confused and so on, I need to take a break and sit down until I feel better. If that is the case, I tell my boss about my low blood sugar and that I need to take a break and that Ill be back in like 15 mins. In average, this happens like 1 time a month at maximum, more like once every 1.5 months. Mostly my coworkers dont even notice my lows because I just treat them and move on.

So what happened last week was my boss taking me aside and telling me that when I need to sit down to recover from a low, she wants me to add that time to my shift and work longer. She also told me that her feet hurt sometimes too and that she would like to sit down and relax too. Excuse me???
I felt so discriminated and hurt. 

T1D is a daily challenge and I am the least person that WANTS to take those breaks, I hate that I have to do all that shit. I feel punished enough by that disease and my boss punishes me even more by expecting me to work longer because of my lows. = It makes me feel like Im doing something wrong, like I am wrong the way I am with having diabetes.
And that dumb comparison of a serious lifelong disease to sometimes hurting feet made me feel so misunderstood. 
Like I would be taking those short breaks for fun and relaxation while in reality there is no alternative, you all know how it is. 

It happens around every 4-6 weeks in absolute maximum that I have to go take a short break, I always try my very best at work and I feel punished, misunderstood and discriminated by my boss for what she expects from me.

A coworker of mine has a type 2 mom and she does not at all understand that its a whole different story than type 1. I bet she went to my boss telling her BuT My MoM MaNaGeS HeR DiAbEtEs oThEr than OP dOeS etc. which clearly isnt helpful. 

What is your guys opinion on that? Am I being too sensitive? Should I just do what she wants me to or should I stand up for myself and tell her that I dont want to do that? Please let me know&",120,0.98,65

Before starting this routine, my insulin:carb ratio was normally 1:5, but went as tight as 1:3.5 around dinner time to make up for (usually) carb-heavy meals and late-night snacking.

Since beginning consistent workouts (as well as counting caloriesbut I dont shy away from carbs) Ive noticed a HUGE decrease in the amount of insulin I use. Normally Id blow through a t:slim cartridge in under 2 days, but now Im over 2 days since my last refill and I still have 160 units left!

More recently he has been complaining about dizziness. My first thoughts were a possible ED. Because I have personal experience with that. I spoke to him, and he promised me he wasn't not eating, although his diet isn't great (ramen noodles, toast and eggs mostly , but he does get in good protein and veggies and fruits a few times a week),  he also does drink multivitamins. 

About a month ago he had a seizure. It was extremely scary. After the fear I got angry, I immediately assumed it was a hypoglycemic induced seizure due to him not eating and lying to me about it. We took him to the doctor and she agreed that it was that because his blood sugar was at a 3. We worked out a better diet for him and he has been following it well. Although sometimes he does skip meals or waits very long between meals, but we've been working on him getting 2000 calories a day at least. Yesterday he had another seizure again. I've done some internet research and read that you can get diabetic seizures. He has most of the symptoms but he doesn't have an increased appetite. Obviously it can be something neurological and I am not ruling that out, but right now diabetes type 1 makes sense. I'm not a doctor and not trying to diagnose him. We will be taking him to the doctor again tomorrow. But I was wondering if it's possible to have diabetes 1 and not have the increased appetite symptom?

Also, are there any other maybe more nuanced signs we can look out for?

But no matter where I look, I can't find anything that agrees with the hard data I have in front of me. The dexcom is picking up that I ate glucose tablets by the next reading.

I'm assuming it's because of my sensor location (chest, above pecs.) But I'm not sure.

It's actually causing issues because it trips an error whenever I take glucose tabs. ""Sensor problem.""

I've been with medtronic for over 20 years now and considering trying the new Omnipod 5 because it works with Dexcom. I'd love to hear feedback  from anyone who has used one. Some questions I have are:

I understand you use a pod for about 3 days and then switch. Does it allow you to run until it's out of insulin, or does it force you to change when there's still insulin left? For instance my medtronic still has several hours worth of insulin even after it says 0 units left.
If there is insulin left can you draw it out of the old pod and add to the new so you don't waste any?

Can you prefill a pod with insulin If you are going to be away from home when you need to change? Or do you have to bring the insulin separate and fill it when ready?

What kind of alarms does it have and do you find them being a bother? Especially at night.

Can you manually suspend/stop insulin delivery if the pump/sensor hasn't caught a low BG in time?

What is the target BG that it tries to keep you at? Can you adjust the target BG or is it hard coded? For instance my medtronic tries to keep you at 120 mg/dl and for higher activity you can use a temp basal mode which is set to a target BG of 150. You cannot change either if these.",2,1,2

RipleyOne,2022-05-21,TIL the Thymus Gland,"https://youtu.be/LmpuerlbJu0

The above video was a great help in understanding the most complex system on earth: Our Immune System. At the 7 to 8 minute mark it discusses ""Murder University"" and the Thymus Gland. A Gland that is responsible for ensuring T Cells that attack our own bodies are destroyed. The Gland diminishes by puberty and is almost non existent in Senior years; explaining the decline in our immune system protection through age. The interesting connection to me is: Does this have a correlation to T Cells attacking the pancreas and a causation of Type 1? Is Type 1 created by a large onset of T Cell production that the Thymus does not properly check and starts a cycle of depleting inlets?  If so wouldn't it seem like the answer to Type 1 is finding a solution to restoring or strengthing the Thymus Gland to ensure new T Cells that are flagged as dangerous are destroyed before entering the system.

Immunosuppression is the current answer to diminish the T Cell count in your body as to protect against the T Cells that made it through the Thymus and cannot differentiate between invaders and good cells. This is often dangerous and has its own problems as the immune system, still not completely understood, is essential to fighting against disease.",2,0.75,0

gugalgirl,2022-06-10,Question for small bodied Omnipod 5 users,"I just met with my endo today to discuss the new omnipod 5. I've been waiting for it with quite a bit of of anticipation, but I was disappointed to learn that the dexcom transmitter and pod need to be ""in sight of each other"" in order for it to properly work. I'm not super tiny, but I do run on the smaller side. My concern is that I'd have to wear both on one arm or one leg at a time and it would be uncomfortable and bulky, not to mention cumbersome and noticeable. I am also very concerned about scar tissue building up and I'm worried this arrangement would negatively impact my ability to properly rotate sites. 

Anyone out there on the Omnipod 5 have tips for rotation and placement on smaller people? Do they really need to be placed close to one another? Is it any more uncomfortable than a regular cgm/omnipod combo? 

For more context:
I'm currently using omnipod dash and freestyle libre 2. I know it's unusual, but I actually prefer the libre over dexcom (I tried it once) because it feels smaller and less bulky. I *hate* the feeling of things attached to my body and bulkiness in general, so it took me years to convince myself to do omnipod and cgm at all. Tubed pumps are completely off the table for me for this reason. I also work in a field where I really need to be as inconspicuous as possible and avoid self disclosure. I don't want people asking me what things are on my body because they are more obviously placed.

elrocko,2022-06-01,Gaming the Minimed Smart Guard System,"I have a 670g with a guardian sensor and transmitter system. I am overall happy with this semi-closed loop system. It has dramatically decreased the number of highs and lows. However, overall, my A1C has crept up when using this system. I've been between a 7.0-7.2 since I started using it. The problem, as I see it, has to do with the system's target BS of 120 mg/dl. It's simply too high. Combine it with a CGM reading that tends to be a bit higher than actual meter levels, and I can see how my A1C is so high.

It seems there is no way to change this 120 target. So here's my idea - just constantly calibrate the CGM by adding 15 mg/Dl to the meter's reading. In effect, this would trick the system into having a 105 mg/dl target. Has anyone tried this? Is it a bad idea?

I'll add that I exercise daily and have a healthy diet. The older I get, the harder it has become for me to keep tight control, despite putting more and more effort into it each year.

_mjade_,2022-06-02,Tandem Pump Question - Pump Reset Alarm? I think pump just reset on me in the night,"I woke up in the middle of the night with my pump telling me it was out of insulin and to change the cartridge. This was unexpected as I had gone to bed with plenty of insulin in the pump! My blood sugars were also not showing on the pump even though my Dexcom was on and otherwise working (my phone was still receiving data).

In a haze, I changed my cartridge. I checked the old cartridge (afraid that my pump had somehow given me all the insulin left in my pump at once!) and fortunately that didn't happen, I still had a bunch of insulin left in the old cartridge.

I went back in my pump alert history and it says I have an alert called, ""Pump Reset Alert 3"". Has anyone else ever had this? Any idea what causes it?? I am so confused, I've only been asleep for an hour and half, this alert went off within fifteen minutes of me falling asleep (and it clearly didn't alarm very loud since it took me over an hour to wake up...).

I'm assuming I haven't been getting any basal insulin for the last hour and half and now I feel queasy, although I'm hoping it's just mentally induced from my anxiety. My blood sugar is 99 and I think an hour and a half without insulin is not enough to get me into a ketone state (I hope).

Luckily, I requested a cgm prescription and discovered the bg was plummeting. (Still pisses me ><c2>) anyway!!! So found a new endo and now Im on tresiba and humalog lispro/fiasp. My diet has been always low carbs of 45g per meal and Korean meals are full on carbs just like Japanese ones = Im still trying all sorts of meals and check the bg post eating but I realised if I consume a high carb meal like Asian noodle soup, though I doubled the dosage it will spike up immediately. When dining out, a lot of side dishes contain sugar here and counting carbs accurately is pretty impossible so I tried home with a pack of instant noodles(79g carbs) and dosed accordingly.

All I ever recall my endo drilling into me is to take care of my sugars to avoid going blind or having a foot amputated, but was never explained the importance of oral hygiene just because of my diabetes. I feel strongly about making this relationship more known to the diabetic population because good oral hygiene should 100% be emphasized and encouraged as a part of diabetes management.

princesszelda_29,2022-06-02,should I up my basal rate or lower my I:C ratio?,"Alright.  I'm in a predicament and awaiting my endos reply back to me.  This sub has been tremendously helpful so I thought I'd come here for opinions on what you guys think I should do. 

I started a new job at a sawmill recently.  I really enjoy it so far because there's no rotating shifts like at my last one.  My shift is from 5am to 3:30pm. 

I think I've figured out my nighttime basal rate as I wake up usually under 5 mmol. I do my 15 minute prebolus and eat my breakfast before the shift begins. It takes beautifully and stays that way until about the 2 hour post meal mark. 

My breakfast is meal prepped and weighed/ carb counted to a T. I've got no doubt this is happening because I underestimated the carb intake.  If anything,  I bolus a bit extra, I feel.  

Example: 5.2 pre breakfast. 
5.0 2 hours later

It then starts to climb and climb to like a 7. Probably would go even higher if I didn't bolus for the next break/snack. Thing is, my basal rate is like 1.1 units/hour. I can sleep with this rate and have a beautiful low, flat line during the night.  So,  why would I need more insulin for when I'm awake and actually moving around? 

Anyhow,  the next prebolus usually takes effect by lowering my sugar within 20 to 25 minutes on my dexcom. Then the cycle continues again. It looks perfect until 2 hours later and then starts a slow, one way creep upwards. =3

I also understand that some of us get our butts beat by the feet on the floor and dawn phenomenon effect. Which I wake up at 3am (when it starts for most people) and eat before 5am.

siblii,2022-06-08,I can't control my sugars,"My sugar often goes high during the morning, low during the middle of the day, high from when I get home to when I go to bed, and is a complete mess during the night. When it's high, I'll correct it, but it won't go down, even if I increase basal rate and override the insulin on board. Being low isn't a problem most of the time, although I've been to the hospital 4 times since I've had T1 because of it and have had to use my glucagon pen once. I use a dexcom and omnipod dash.

During the night, I won't wake up to alarms despite max volume, and my parents have to correct me or get carbs if I'm low. I feel guilty and like I'm a burden for them because this happens most nights.

I'm starting to have vision problems too, and my A1C has been high every time I've gone to the doctor. I've had mental health issues for a while, and have had T1 for about 3 years. I'm 15 and a highschool freshman.

PS. Anybody got a name for this phenomenon of becoming sicker than a normal person, all I can think of is 'immune-system disorder'.

Ok, not exceptional but wait.  I was 28 upon arrival to the ER.  I knew I was going down so I started chugging Gatorade. No response just further down.  I disconnected from my pump about an hour prior to the ER.  So when I got there they finally got an iv and did an amp of D50.  Nothing.  Then another.  Nothing.  Then finally on the third I went up to 185 but quickly went right back down.  It was so bad I thought my ER nurse was going to have a nervous breakdown. Eventually I was admitted to icu but I was on a dextrose drip and still off my pump and could barely maintain 60s.  Then as quickly as it came it went.  About 28 hrs off my pump and continued dextrose drip and I was able to maintain my sugar.  Discharged I went home with 0 explanations.

EDIT: So, Im not advocating for this. Im just having trouble finding good sources and the seizures Ive had are severe. Like, wont survive too many more.  Im somewhere between desperate and wanting to just disprove my dad because its one thing to go to another country for specialty procedures (or because youre dying and US healthcare is an actual dystopian nightmare), but this&is sketchy as hell, in the least. 

That said, other countries are doing a lot more with stem cell research because Bushs laws basically made very stringent constraints on research  so much so that it covers non-embryonic stem cells. 

The other OTHER issue is that we have, many times, successfully treated diabetes, either through lessening or total abatement, for a indeterminate periods of time. One of the reasons its not approved is because trials cant validate consistent treatment because its literally based on your immune system.  And its a severely limited resource.

A big issue for me on MDI is having to compensate exercise with food which ultimately discourages me from doing it.

treethroughstone,2022-05-25,Weight Loss - Semaglutide Experience,"I have been T1 for about 25 years. Over the years since my diagnosis, I have gradually gotten more and more overweight to the point of (non morbid) obesity. It was never sudden, but I always ended the year a little heavier than I started it, and I never managed to successfully diet. I was always hungry. I would obsess over food constantly, always thinking about my next meal or snack. Lows would trigger binges - I had a lot of issues with lows. (My control has generally been decent, but before CGMs, I would have severe lows involving seizures, etc. Very grateful to have been on the TSlim/Dexcom combo since 2020, which has ended my serious lows.)

Anyway, long story short, I heard about the use of semaglutides in Type 1s on a podcast so I asked my endo if we could try it. I thought it might help me lose weight. Worth a shot, right?

I cant tell you how strange it has been to suddenly NOT think about food. Sometimes I forget to eat! THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED TO ME! I am legitimately just not hungry most of the time. The weight is falling off. I dont understand how it could be this effective. 

Has anyone else tried this? How does this work? Why does it work? Will it continue to help me, or will the effect wane over time?

If it matters: my endo opted to put me on Rybelsus (a daily oral version of semaglutide), but to reduce my costs, we are thinking to switch over to Trulicity (injectable semaglutide) assuming it works ok for me. Apparently nausea can be an issue. TBD. The drug also sometimes comes under the name Ozempic or Wegovy.

Since using the new technology my sugars are nowhere close to what they were before. First, the 5 hour insulin duration is garbage in my opinion. Fast acting insulin does not continue working that long and you can't change it. Which is leading yo higher blood glucose throughout the day. 
Second, you can't change the blood glucose range of 70 to 180. Again, this leads to higher glucose, especially after meals.

Pros for accu-chek: familiar concept, while the cons are the wires and the room in my pocket for the pump.

Pros for the omnipod: no wires, been recommended repeatedly by other diabetic friends. While the cons are the size of the pod, sites might be problematic ( my usual sites are abdomen, just below the belt, higher thigh). Honestly its just nitpicking because of unfamiliar ground.

AvalieV,2022-06-03,Had a lovely encounter with a fellow Type 1 while walking my Dog,"So I took my Dog out for a walk this afternoon and when I was walking by a school park area with some benches noticed an older couple (in their 50's) sitting on a bench listening to a podcast. I didn't think much of it and continued to walk my (super slow) dog around them, but recognized a few words and realized they were listening to an islet cell transplant podcast!

I walked up and apologized for overhearing and confirmed my suspicions. The lady looked so shocked I knew what it was about after 30 seconds of listening haha. We chatted for about 10-15 minutes about Pumps, CGM's (we both used Dexcoms, but she was on a Tandem pump and I use a Medtronic), and all things diabetic, including childhood experiences, etc.

I was sad to hear her say that after 42 years of being a Type 1, since she was 14, that she had not met many diabetics before. Sometimes we take for granted social spaces like this one full of us to share with. 

Anyways, I didn't get her name or anything, but just thought it was a really nice random encounter where I could speak freely with someone who actually understood what I was talking about. I always comment on people's CGM's and show mine on my arm if I see them!

jamiethediabetic,2022-06-04,Post DKA Coping,"Here to vent and ask for coping skills. 

Tuesday (my 4th diaversary) was pretty normal. I was at 150 at 4pm, and then I ate a peanut butter sandwich. My pump (tandem) was leaking so I went high, fixed the problem, bolused a second time. By 8pm I was right around 400 and really feeling it. My dex read a down arrow, so I decided to try to sleep it off. Big mistake. An hour later I got up to chug some water and pee and did a fingerstick- 485. I kept pushing insulin and chugging water but around midnight I starting puking my guts out. My stomach felt settled after so I fell asleep on the couch for about an hour, then woke up, feeling like I was having a heart attack. My boyfriend drove me to the ER where my blood sugar was 536 and they officially called it DKA. I was admitted and spent three nights in the hospital. Now I'm home, and frankly scared. This happened so fast. I hadn't been in DKA since I was initially diagnosed, and that came on so slow- over about 3 months. 

All the doctors recommended to stop using my pump, and after this whole experience, I happily did. I've had four people at my endo (two MDs, an NP, and CDE) tell me that the tandem pump is the best on the market and when I've complained about it not working properly, they don't listen. I have an appointment with someone new next week, and for what it's worth, I don't care what I am told about this pump, I am at the very least taking a break from it. 

I'm honestly just so scared of this happening again. I've barely stopped crying since about Wednesday night, and just need to calm down some.",34,0.95,37

He is currently still in the ICU as they try to stabilize him and we will be here for a few more days as we learn how to care for him before we can go home. I understand it will be a lifestyle change for the family and with him being so little I am very very scared and nervous.

Kiarasam06,2022-06-14,Really Sad Today,"Not to be dramatic, but today I am all up in my feelings. My son was dx 6.5 weeks ago. It's been insanity. I am obsessed with his Dexcom, I check it CONSTANTLY. I know it's not healthy, but I am so scared he is going to drop and I will miss it and then disaster. I micromanage it all. It's all so tiring. I'm tired and I can't be. My husband is helpful but is kinda nonchalant about it. It's his nature to be laid back, and well, I'm not. That irritates me that he's not also micromanaging, which would annoy me too, so like wtf do I want????? Anxiety is bad. I've always been anxious, but not like this. I worry 99% of the day about how he's doing...am I doing enough? How can we do better?  When will drop next? Do I have all the supplies? 

 I am also mourning life pre-diabetes if that's a thing. I just feel so fn sad. I hate this for him. I wish I could take it away and I can't and it sucks. I feel like all the joy of eating has gone out the door. It's freaking the most stressful thing ever. 

He is currently honeymooning and it too sucks so bad. He keeps dropping low, despite hardly any insulin. He's only had Lantus today, and no insulin w meals thus far....He is literally on 1:60 ratio and 5u of Lantus,  (today is our first day of ratio changes due to honeymooning), and today he's been dropping low, low 70s, and high 60s. I feel like we will never be stable. I hate honeymooning. Every meal is a guessing game. I'm scared to give insulin and scared to not give him insulin. 

All in all, my son is doing well. He's not upset/sad, he's taken to it like a champion. Not me, I feel like life has changed and will never be ""normal."" I just feel sad.",33,0.9,66

daprei,2022-05-25,question from a gf,"TLDR: Do you consider yourself to be disabled?

My boyfriend of 2 years has T1D and therefore I have gotten to know a lot about it. I see firsthand everything he goes through because of it that I simply never have to think about and have taken for granted. Sometimes hell go low in the middle of the night 3 or more times and have to get up and eat carbs and get terrible sleep because of it, or feel shitty at work all day from being high or from going up and down several times. Obviously, he has to think about everything he eats and dose for it/consider BG before eating it. (You all understand all this but just stating things I am able to observe from my perspective.) To me, these are things that affect his daily life in ways that myself and others simply dont think about. Therefore, I would say he is disabled, although he is obviously a capable human being and can live a normal life, it disables him at some points and causes it to be harder for him. When I talk to my family about it, who dont see all this firsthand, I sometimes say hes disabled to explain why Im not comfortable at large events and keep my mask on. They understand that he is immunocompromised but have insisted many times, Well, hes not actually disabled, though. This kind of makes me angry because I see how much more he has to do on a daily basis just to keep himself alive. Basically, my question is, do you consider yourself to be disabled as a Diabetic person? Or am I out of line for thinking this? Edit: he also says he is disabled.",32,0.94,57

sunny_in_pbo,2022-06-07,What do I Need to Know?,"Hi friends. I am brand new to this community - just joined today. 

I was diagnosed with late onset T1D yesterday, at 27 years old, and 19+3  weeks pregnant. I had gone into what was supposed to be a gender-confirming ultrasound on Friday last week, but was told that my OB's office accidentally booked it as a regular appointment. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise because they found sugar spill-over in my urine, and my BG pricked at 451. 

A1-C labs came back for 8.9 over the last 90 days, which led them to rule out Gestational Diabetes. My doctor called yesterday to have me admitted to the hospital, so I've been here since last night. They gave me both Lispro and NPH, and I got down to a 77 after dinner! Woke up to a 130 after fasting. 

They're keeping me here until tonight or tomorrow, most likely, and I am not sure what all I need to know before I leave. This was totally unexpected and shocking to me - I failed to ask any questions at my OB on Friday, and I don't want to miss anything before I leave the care of people who actually know what they're doing here at the hospital. Lol

I'm gonna throw out a few questions here, but any and all feedback would be SO appreciated. My brain is overwhelmed right now with new information and worries for my baby. Just looking for some guidance from people who know the ins and outs of this disease. Thank you in advance!

I feel bad because due to how my brain works, this freaks me out and I shut down, and I get super cautious around him for the rest of the day. 
I dont want him to feel bad because I know its not his fault and I wonder how I can act that will make my presence during his highs less unpleasant and how I can communicate to him that I understand its not his fault at all and that this issue is mostly about how my brain functions.
Also, sometimes I feel like I act too protective of him (Im an overall very protective person) and worry that he might see that as me thinking he cant take care of  his own health. Any of you guys have had a partner that acted too protective ? What were the things they did that annoyed you? (So I can avoid doing them).

Im very new to relationships and my partner is so amazing, I want to be as good to them as they are to me.",20,0.92,24

Awkward_Track_62,2022-06-16,Insulin Question," 

Hi Everyone! Looks like I'm a new addition to the type 1 diabetes reddit crew! A bit of history before my question. I am 35 years old and recently diagnosed with type 1, 3 weeks ago. Found out because my blood sugar was hovering around 550mg/dl and suffering from some major dka. All in all I've had to adjust my diet but I was exercising 5 days a week so it seems like my life hasn't changed much apart from cutting out a lot of carby food.

Anyways... The endo prescribed me with XULTOPHY. It's one shot to be taken in the morning per day and thats it. I've read this is more for diabetes type 2 medication? Also, is any other type 1 out there just getting by with 1 shot per day? I'm asking because on reddit I see so many people discussing bolus shots pre meal etc?

Any help is appreciated. Thanks guys!",18,1,28

Mouse_Upper,2022-05-27,A minor dealing with a unmanageable guardian.,Hello..Im a 14F and I am struggling immensely right now. I wad diagnosed 11/21/20 after a coma associated with DKA. I live with my grand parents but they even though they are my grandparents they arent very old (in their 50s). Ive been doing MDI ever since I was diagnosed so nearing 2 years. I desperately want an insulin pump. Ive brought it up to my endo and shes 100% on board but my grandmas not. She refuses to let me get one. She said its to noticeable. The day she said that I wanted to Kms. Genuinely wanted be not alive. The MDIs have been traumatic for me. I have had many instances where I will inject and it will burn so bad it feels like Im injecting acid and its melting my skin. Ive screamed and cried and ultimately stopped taking them all together. My grandma noticed a girl she works with had an insulin pump and asked her about it. Apparently the girl has had it since she was 9 and my grandma told me she only has one because its so severe and its never gone away. In my head I was screaming. She think my diabetes is going to go away. Its never going too. After telling me that she yelled at me and told me she wasnt going to talk about it right now because she has more important things to do. That night I had some pretty bad thoughts. Like really bad I probably shouldnt say or else I will get in a lot of trouble. Im done taking my shots altogether. Im just done. Ive punched myself in the head repeatedly and have tried to attempt before over this. I would rather be dead at this point. I dont know what to do anymore.,17,0.9,25

So strange to think back to being in a hospital bed near death and then now, celebrating that day and living in the awareness of how precious and fleeting it all is.

They're not doing any favours for type 1 diabetic people, if anything they are making our lives harder. Many people know very little about diabetes so the general populace may assume that its helping us, but the only diabetes that exists to them is type 2.

""Oh my kid might get it but that's okay, it's not the end of the world"" ""My kid got it but what the hell, it isn't the end of the world"". I beg to differ. When I got diagnosed with T1D, it was and still is the end of my world. I was diagnosed nearly 2 years ago and I am still unaccustomed to it. I haven't been happy since. And there's no guarantee that your child won't end up like me, no matter how much you shower them with love and support or how good of a parent you think you are. Some people just can't accept life being disabled. And I'm tired of people thinking diabetes is some sort of triviality, some afterthought.

Today, I scheduled an appointment with the pediatrician to talk about my concerns. My baby is super active, so I was told that there was nothing to worry about and was sent home. 

I felt relief at first, but as I was driving home Im still stressing that the possibility is still there. I guess I was under the assumption there would be some type of test or bloodwork to rule it out, but I didnt request any of it after I was told not to worry about it. My baby only has those two symptoms as far as I am aware, so maybe Im being paranoid.

Not that I'm saying anyone should. Just me personally. I'm tired of being this way. I'm tired of having a body that obviously would be dead if I didn't have my medicine. I'm tired of taking insulin everyday. And this is for the rest of my life. I never asked for any of this. Why do I have to live  this way when I clearly don't want to. Everything sucks. The world is dying. I don't want to be 21 and everyone else around me can be ""normal"". I have no friends. I have no social life. I never have energy to do anything anymore. I can barely remember my life. My memory loss has gotten so bad I can barely remember what I said 5 minutes ago. What's even the point? Having a chronic illness, PTSD, memory loss its just too much. I hate this. I hate life. It honestly has no meaning to me. I can't even find a purpose to take this insulin that I'm very fortunate for to have. I feel so hopeless. Like I'm trapped in a box and there's no way out.

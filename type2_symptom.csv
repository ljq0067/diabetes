sauvageonautopilot,2024-06-12,Im Killing Myself ,"This is hard to post because I always thought I could manage this on my own. Thats not the case. My diabetes has been my dirty secret. From binges of candies, cakes, and all of the most dangerous food to yeast infections, to nocturnal enuresis& no one would be able to tell. I am a hardworking 28 years old business owner and home owner whos 2 years away from graduating from a PhD& and no one but my partner knows that I pee the bed most days of the week because of my overconsumption of sugar. No one knows that I worry about when I will go blind. No one knows that theres a slight panic I feel when Ive slept on my hand overnight and feeling doesnt come back until the next day, sometimes the next 2 days. Why should I need peoples sympathy? I did this to myself. Ive done such a good job of convincing everyone that Im okay, but Im not. Every single food choice I make favours my indulgence. With every bite, I am taking one step closer to death. I am dying slowly.  My A1C is 12. Im too young. Its not my time to go so I am making a promise that I will stay. As long as I can and to be as healthy as I can. Ive fallen off the wagon so many times but I have no other option at this time. Please let me know if you relate to any part of my story. I need to know that I am not alone in this. ",131,0.96,129,pee
Particular-Quote-536,2024-06-17,4 month follow up. Im just about in tears!,"35 M. Over this past Christmas I went home to visit family. I knew something was wrong. Constantly thirsty and constantly peeing. This went on for weeks and after a quick google search I remember that sinking feeling when I saw what it most likely meant. On February 1st I was diagnosed with an A1C of 11.4. Triglycerides were higher than snoop dogg at 688. LDL cholesterol was 274. My doc prescribed mounjaro and Lipitor. I witched to keto, started fasting, and began walking 10k steps a day and lifting weights 3 days a week. Today I went in for my follow up. Triglycerides 179, LDL 70, A1C& 5.1! It is hard to describe how I feel right now. I know I still have a long tough road ahead of me but seeing some serious results after 4 months of hard work gives me a lot of hope!",105,0.99,50,pee
JanKnight1994,2024-06-24,Yearly Checkup,"Hey all!
I love the support that y'all share so I wanted to share my story.
In 2018 I was diagnosed with an A1C close to 9. I went in after needing to constantly pee. My girlfriend (no wife) sat with me when I got nauseous at the finger prick and blood since my family had a history of diabetes (type one and two). Only one that doesn't have it is my sister.
My partner was nothing less than supportive during 99% of our relationship. Wife's her up. No physical activity added though when we got married. I weighed probably 240ish?
2021 rolls around and I move to another apartment in the same complex with her and our kiddo. Brother notices that I'm not as strong as I used to be and asks to hangout the next day.
He shows me his home gym and we try a few workouts, focusing on form and not hurting myself I figured it was a one off and he says ""so what time are we working out tomorrow?"".
It's been almost three years and I've gone from 258 to 197ish. Admittedly I am on Mounjaro, but that's more so for A1C control than anything else.
I'm aware that I've done a ton of the work, but wanted to recognize my BAMF of a wife, BAMF of a kid for understanding (yes I still take TONS of time for her) and BAMF of a brother.
All of them literally saved my life.

Last week I went to my yearly appointment and my A1C was 5.0. There's still tons of work to do with a goal of weighing 185 and continuing to add muscle, but I'm seeing so many results. Back when I started I used to get winded going up the stairs and could only jog for a few seconds. Now I'm going 15-20 minutes no stopping.

It CAN be done and if you think you're alone, everyone here has got your back. Y'all had mine.",10,1,1,pee
lilbirdie12,2024-06-30,Success stories! Share your story to help others!,"Lets talk about your success stories, how you got there and what positive affects its had! Im still working on it and just got a cgm and finally kicked coke! Im at a 6.2 and it used to be 7. Wanting to be down to 5.7 to be our it prediabetes range before my next pregnancy so I wont have to go on insulin again. 
I can already tell a difference in energy and tingling in the feet. Biggest thing I notice is the peeing! I thought I had an overactive bladder but I think it was my body trying to get rid of excess sugar. I seriously used to be 20+ times a day and I hated it. Now its more associated with how much Im drinking and its easier to tell if Im dehydrated etc. ",9,1,15,pee
deerestme,2024-06-15,Rant: It's unfair ,"I'm sorry for the temper tantrums.

I'm living with the consequences of being unhealthy, eating fast food and living sedentary. I (F27) am currently 160 lbs and being overweight. I used to be skinny with a high metabolism. I was invincible. Then weight gain slowly crept up during the pandemic, but I ignored it. Then came the symptoms of peeing constantly, sleeping after eating too many carbs, dry mouth, rashes, and darkened skin areas. Next thing you know, I have type 2 diabetes.

I want to cry. I resent my family history and genetics. My mother was pre diabetic, but I'm proud of her for changing her diet, whoop. I will look to her for motivation. I also hate being Black, because Black people are more prone to getting Type 2, and ""ghetto people"" have it. 

 I used to look down on Type 2 Diabetics, because 90% percent of people are T2 and I'm now in that statistic, as an irresponsible person who ate unhealthy. I'm basically Paula Deen. Fast food, white bread and potatoes should be banned, because it causes Type 2 Diabetes. There are times that I'm jealous of my friends and family, because they'll never know what it's like. I'm forcing my future children to eat healthy so they won't end up like me. I'm jealous that I won't have a normal pregnancy like anyone else because I'm high risk. 

I should be grateful that Type 2 Diabetes isn't as serious as Type 1 is. Type 1 and Type 2 should be separate from each other.

I want to take this one step at a time and stop throwing tantrums. My diagnosis is a blessing in disguise. I want to have a low carb diet.",5,0.67,20,pee
LadyCremeBrulee,2024-06-15,I'm struggling and constantly thirsty. Help?,"Hi everybody. It's been a while since I posted here. I don't think I'm doing very well with my diabetes. I'm struggling with remembering to take my meds and slipping back on some old eating habits. Bad me, I know...

My main reason for making a post is I'm always needing a drink. It's really odd to me that I feel like a dry sponge constantly needing fluids when, for nearly my whole life I've felt like a cactus or a camel going long periods with little fluid. 
It's gotten to the point where I'm drinking so much that I burp it up and have that nasty acid reflux. Even then, my tongue feels so dry and cottony. 

I'm trying to stick with water and iced tea. Though sometimes I'll have a diluted juice because I get tired of the taste of water. :( This excessive thirst, though, is starting to worry me. Because of all of the drinking, I've been needing to pee nearly every 15-20 minutes instead of my every 30 minutes to an hour. 

I wish i could see my doctor, but the insurance ran out at the start of this month due to a new job change. The new insurance hasn't been picked out yet from the marketplace, so I can't do much. 

Any clue on what's happening? Any advice or tips I can do until I see my doctor again or a new doctor? We're also moving next month, so it's not so great timing. I guess all the stress of preparing to move and no insurance has been stressing me out and, in turn, forgetting to take meds and....sigh... thanks for listening to my ranting woe. Need sleep... and more water =<a7>=<a7>=<a7>=<a7>=<a7>=<a7>",1,0.6,11,pee
Blue119223,2024-06-13,Bleeding blood  ," It is definitely isnt normal (english is not my first language please so dont mind it) my mom 54 bleed blood out of her pee around 4 times and she went to multiple hospitals but they said they do not know what the cause is. My mother says it probably is because her diabetes pills she kept taking but she cannot stop taking it since it helps her diabetes. She lives in china so we dont know the exact name but it is a pill she have to take whenever she eats (it basically lower her blood sugar so she can eat) and if she dont eat after the pills, then her blood sugar will continue to drop so it would be very dangerous. And according to my mom the pills any pills you take causes certain damage to your organ in this case it would be her kidneys. I am very worried because she cannot stop the pills as there is no other ways so basically the symptoms will continue until it gets worse and she \_\_\_. But I do not think this is the only way? I feel like the medicine or knowledge is significant lower because is this really the only way? I do not know what to do we are canadian but she lives in china mainly do you think if she goes back to canada there would be other ways to solve this problem because basically the hospital knows the medicine she takes causes problems to her kidneys and it probably made her to continue to bleed blood but they cannot stop the medicine or else if you stop it the sugar will drown the organs? But if you take the medication it would still damage the kidney but less damage than no medicine? And the hospital basically told her that there would be no change and she should continue her plan? Please tell me this is not normal or like there is other ways? She never tried other treatments etc (pardon my knowledge for diabetes is also very low but Im trying my best to learn more about it and what to do ) Thank you. Also according to my mother she says those who take diabetes pills later on will also bleed blood as it damage other organs so (it is the norm) for those who have diabetes but I do not think it is normal? In my perspective is the pills make you bleed blood and who knows the other damages it cause to your body that you do not see, then you should stop the plan or there are other pills to take? But is it really true that there is no other way? Bleeding blood sounds like something that is very serious",3,0.81,6,pee

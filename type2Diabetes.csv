ComprehensiveSafe550,2022-06-04,A Few Questions,"Hello,

I am currently concerned about potentially having T2 Diabetes. As some background, I am still quite young for my age (in my twenties), but my father and uncle both had T2 diabetes. His father might have had it as well, so I'm scared it's gonna come for me.

Recently, my urine has had a strong odor to it. It's not sickly sweet, but it seems familiar and yet I can't quite put my finger on it. I decided to get a very tiny lick of it to see if it tasted sweet. It did not and it was salty instead.

1. Does this mean my urine does not have a high amount of glucose in it? Or is it possible for urine to have high amounts of sugar and still not be remotely sweet?
2. I read a lot about excessive urination being a symptom of diabetes. Is this because excessive thirst is also a symptom (as in, because you're drinking more water frequently, you urinate more frequently), or do people who drink normal amounts of water still get excessive urination? I only get excessively thirsty after eating an insane amount of carbs, which I think is normal. I only excessively urinate after drinking a bottle of water very quickly, which I also think is normal, but I could be wrong here.

I am definitely gonna go to a doctor soon but there are some circumstances which are currently preventing me from doing so at the moment, so I'm here asking in the meantime in an attempt to assuage my fears. I'm also gonna get a glucometer soon. It's a crazy thing since around 2.5 weeks ago, I did a test 2 hours after eating a high-carb meal and registered at 107 (it was not a high-fat food like pizza). Can things really change this quickly over 2.5-3 weeks? I've been very stressed recently as well, so that might have done it. Thank you for answering my questions.",1,0.67,6
lemoncry_,2022-06-02,It's so hard to avoid the 1 hour pp +30 points spike.,"\- F24 prediabetic/insulin resistant.  
\- Last A1C on Jan 5.1%.  
\- Currently trying to gain weight and off metformin for that same reason.

The only way I seem to not get a +30 spike after 1 hour of eating is by having ONLY vegetables, fat and  protein. Since I am trying to gain some weight, my doctor said to include complex carbs to my diet (beans, quinoa, etc) but 1/2 slice of rye bread will give me a 40 points spike 1h post meal even when pairing it with eggs, avocado, cheese, veggies and a 30 minute walk.

It seems like I can't have any carbs (even healthy ones) at all and it's so depressing, frustrating and I'm starving all the time. 

I don't know what to do, I am very underweight due to cutting off carbs but it seems i simply can't have them if I want to stay in range. My fasting/pre meal numbers are good, always under 100 but I can go from 74 to 110 after 1 hour by having 1 strawberry at the end of an only veggies+protein+fat meal. 

At this point I'm going against my doctors advise by not eating because I'm too scared of messing up and having too many spikes.

Any input is appreciated, thank you.",1,1,16
Madluck90,2022-06-01,Does any experienced increase in BG after consuming Finasteride for Hair Loss ?,"So I visited Dermatologist for my Hair loss and he prescribed me Finasteride.Obviously knowing that I was a diabetic and my last HbA1C was 5.8 he told that this medication wont effect BG .

My Fasting BG was around 90-95 mg/dl on regular basis and PP after lunch and dinner lies between 110-120 mg/dl most of the time .

After started consuming this Finasteride my BG numbers started to rise after 3-4 days like my Fasting BG now comes around 103-104 mg/dl .PP rose to 145 mg/dl .I consumed this medicine for 6 days and now its been 3 days I have stopped consuming it but still by BG numbers are same as fasting BG 104 -108 and PP- 145 .

During my last HbA1C test which came out 5.8 my Endo reduced my dose from Metformin 1000 mg to 500 mg and its been a month now but the numbers were around same before I started consuming this Finasteride.

Can anyone suggest on what could be wrong because I havent changed much in diet though my workout was not in regularity this month but it didnt effect my BG as I constantly tracked it .

WildIris2021,2022-05-30,Issues consuming protein / meat with Ozempic or other diabetes meds?,"Has anyone developed a sensitivity to eating meat or proteins since getting in Ozempic or other diabetes meds?

Ill try to keep it brief. Ive developed really awful digestive issues. Very bad diarrhea. In the last year its become not just a daily issue but multiple times each day. 

I saw the doctor and he blamed diabetes meds. Sent me to a nutritionist. 

In the meantime I realized my stomach is getting upset mostly when I eat meat. I stopped eating meat and the issue almost instantly started to resolve.  Its not gone but its more like 1-2 times per week issue rather than a daily issue.

alejandrosourusRex57,2022-05-28,Unsure what is going on,"Not really sure what is going on but I have been feeling very tired the last 2 months along with numerous other Type 2 symptoms (sweet urine, 2 dizzy spells that caused me to slowly go to the ground, scabs healing much slower, hot flash after eating any meal, dry mouth, always thirsty). I noticed the sweet urine about a month ago and I cant stop thinking about it. Interesting enough, I had my my A1c tested at my health provider 8/7/2019 and was at 105 mg/dl , and again on 10/13/2021...which also resulted at 105 mg/dl. on 5/20/22 I tested positive for Covid, first time for me too, and now I have to wait to have a negative result before I can go in to get tested again for possible prediabetes. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have already reached out to my primary and they suggested I not worry at this time and to come in and test when I am clear of the Covid, but I cant stop thinking about all these issues. Im not hungry and I am seriously concerned with eating because I just dont know anything about this. I also dont want to go to any stores to risk getting anyone else sick. Any advice or support would be great, but I am just really scared right now. I am a decently healthy person, who rides mountain bikes and road bikes regularly, I am 5'8"" and was 185lbs on 5/19 and today I am 173lbs.

OpportunityPleasant,2022-05-26,Diabetes met Forman side effects diarrhea low pancreatic enzymes and fecal fat abnormal,I have this question . Recently I went to the doctor and she said your hb1ac was 8.2 and you have to raise your does to 1000mg . I (didnt use it for 2 years ). Since then I have diarrhea or couple of days later . 3 weeks later I had still diarrhea so I went to a gastroenterologist he checked all labs and said everything was fine slight elevated ALT level of 65 . Main reason is you have low pancreatic enzymes insufficiency of 123 it has to be more than 200 . And fat in your stool . But if diarrhea is due to metformin then there is a chance of these numbers go down ??? Does this happened to anyone ? I can manage diabetes but not insufficiency am looking for that glimmer hope out there . I started on enzymes creon . My provider was on leave will be back on June 3rd so waiting .,1,0.67,4

FriedBack,2022-05-23,Statins and Blood Sugar,"Im starting a new, stronger cholesterol medication and looking for your experiences navigating that. 
  For the uninitiated (I envy you.) - statins have a small risk of causing or exacerbating Type 2 Diabetes. Most often the benefits outweigh the risks. I happen to have a family history of high cholesterol and heart disease. About 2 years ago I developed Type 2 and am since back in the Prediabetic range with diet, exercise and testing. 
  When I was diagnosed I asked my doctor to switch me to Pravastatin as it is less intense and thus causes less strain on the pancreas. My LDL (bad cholesterol) is very high now and my HDL is low. I had been having chest pain but a CT scan ruled out any blockages. My cardiologist feels its still best to go on Crestor - a much stronger statin. Although my major vessels are free of plaque, I could still have tiny blockages in capillaries that tests cannot pick up. Im 37, and my father died of congestive heart failure at 54. Im overweight but I really dont eat too many things that contribute to the problem. (No deep fried, butter, fatty meats, cane sugar etc.) My activity level isnt what it could be right now because of chronic pain.
  I have worked so hard to get my glucose under control without starting Metformin. Im afraid this will  ruin that. What are your experiences with taking Crestor or similar statins? What are some things youve done to mitigate it?
TL;DR: Have you taken Crestor and did it make your glucose tolerance go down?",1,1,3

a_harsher_california,2022-06-17,urgency of checking glucose levels? (newly diagnosed &amp; waiting for supplies),"Hi, I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about two weeks ago, with an A1C of 11. My doctor prescribed the Dexcom G6 at that initial appointment, but my insurance requires prior authorization and after multiple attempts I'm having difficulty reaching my doctor to have her submit the prior authorization. 

So as of now, I don't have any way to check my glucose levels, and no real timeline for when I can expect to hear back from my doctor. I'm wondering how big of a problem this is and what the urgency is. I'm not sure whether I need to purchase a simpler glucose monitor and test strips over the counter in the interim? Or how long is reasonable/safe to go between the initial diagnosis and being able to check my glucose levels regularly? Thank you!",1,0.67,10

KalashaCola,2022-05-24,Am I Diabetic Or Just A Moron?,"My doctor told me I was prediabetic about two years ago. I've never had ""high"" blood sugar after meals or fasting (and whatever ""highs"" I've had have been statistical highs 101 after fasting instead of 99). I lost 100 pounds and I've been feeling great. My A1C is normal (although it's never been ""high"").

I'm taking prednisone and some kind of NSAID for eczema and this afternoon I started feeling really hypoglycemic from not eating - while it's not the greatest idea, I took both of these medicines at that time and then started to feel worse so I had two glasses of OJ and then had lunch. Afterwards I started feeling really awfu (dizzy, disoriented, anxiety ridden) and I tested my sugar and it was 235.

In my lifetime, I've never had a result over 175 even after eating and I've certainly never seen 200 and above and the 235 began to fade super fast. Within 45 minutes I was down to 140 (which I'd say is about average for eating a slightly carb heavy lunch).

I'm just curious because I know almost nothing about diabetes and it kind of worried me to see such a high result. I looked both medicines up and they can both contribute to high blood sugar levels and feeling how I felt. 

So I'm just asking - should I be more diligent in monitoring my numbers still or should I say this is a one-off and not let myself descend into hypochondria and panic.",0,0.33,13

Personal_Ambition540,2022-06-16,Do I have diabetes?,"Hey! Im somewhat scared and anxious atm and Id appreciate some help& (sorry for the lengthy post)
Im a 22-year-old male (~140-150lbs). Im not very active, but I work out maybe 1-2 times a week for 30-60 minutes, and my diet is very carb heavy. A couple of months ago I got my blood checked and had an okay HBA1c of 5.4. Theres no diabetes history in my family. 

Last week I bought myself a continuous glucose monitor, out of curiosity, I wanted to see how my body reacts to different kinds of foods. Ive been wearing it for a few days, and while my fasting glucose levels are good (usually around 80-90 every night so far), Ive noticed a couple of abnormalities after eating. For one, I sometimes have multiple spikes post meal (usually 2-3 spikes over the course of 2-4 hours& going up, going down below 140, up again even higher than before, etc. until my glucose finally relaxes to normal levels). Until today though, my blood sugar hasnt gone above ~150mg/dl so I thought thats still alright. 

Today however, I had Chinese food for dinner. Then I looked at my cgm and my blood sugar went all the way up to 185mg/dl& then it slightly dropped, then about 30-60 min later went to over 200mg/dl, and stayed in that range for a few hours (going down slightly, going up again). This seems like a crazy high value& I read that healthy people sometimes can have big spikes, but 170-200 mg/dl for hours?? I realize reading that also gave me anxiety which probably affected that even more, but still& Can anyone with experience tell me how serious this is?

sampson4141,2022-06-07,"New to T2, Looking for Meal Plan","Hello, I was diagnosed with T2 and have been really struggling with the transition to a diabetes diet.  I am a busy professional used to eating out a lot.  I was thinking that a meal kit plan would help.  I get that they are expensive, but I think it would be helpful for my transition  to the lifestyle.

The one thing that I am concerned about these meal kit plans is when I look at the sample food menus, it often includes things I am told to avoid.  In particular, I see white potatos, white rice, and things that look like it contains processed flour in it.  One plan even had a few deserts like cheesecakes in it.  When I looked at the nutritional page it said it was 22g of carbs, no added sugars.

I am just curious if this is OK, like occassionally with portion control a little bit of high glycemic foods are OK, or if these plans are something I should avoid.

The one I have been looking at is BistroMD but if anyone has any suggestions I would appreciate it.  I am not looking for the cheapest one or the best tasting food, I would prefer the one that is best for diabetics to help control it.

Thanks.

Edit: I was only looking at meal kit plans that say they are for a diabetic diet or have a version that is for diabetics. Not a general one like Blue Apron. ",6,1,7

icemanind,2022-05-26,Insulin no longer working,"I am a type 2 diabetic, diagnosed about 2 years ago. When I first got diagnosed, my A1C was at about 15. I worked hard to get my blood sugars under control. After modifying my diet and exercise and thanks to the medication I am taking, My last A1C was at 6.9 and the one before that was at 6.6. 

The medication my doctor has me taking is two Metformin in the morning and two at night. In the morning, I also take 40 units of Basaglar. And before I eat my meals, I take 1 unit of Novalog per 15 carbs of food I am consuming. So if I'm eating 45 carbs, I'd take 3 units of Novalog before my meal.

This has been working great for me for the last year and has kept my A1C below 7. However, for some reason, the insulin no longer seems to be working. For the last 2 months or so, my blood sugars, regardless of how much Novalog I take, always seems to be about 250, teetering on the 300 line, even in the morning when I first wake up.

I have not changed my diet or my exercise. I went to my doctor and he ran tests to make sure I don't have any infections and that came back clean.

He isnt overweight at all, he has lost a lot of muscle mass in the last year, but isnt Keto for weight *loss*?

How can we help him get on track? I know there is no easy or fast fix and he has a long road ahead of him, but where do we even start? Aside from checking blood sugar, eating consistently, and taking his insulin and meds?

Just typing this out makes us sound like the worst kids in the world, but tbh, hes always been able to physically work and he has duties that keep him busy, plus he is very independent. He had been hiding quite a bit of this for a long time and telling us he was fine and things were good. We didnt understand the severity until now.

Edit: thank you for your responses, they are very helpful. We will set goals and get a plan. I appreciate it!",5,1,5

kjmacsu2,2022-06-18,CGM - Insurance for Type 2?,"I am coming up to my one-year anniversary of joining this club, and thinking back, the biggest game changer in getting my blood sugar under control was my CGM.  It relieved a lot of anxiety I was having between finger sticks and really taught me how my body works.

Having said that my insurance will in now way pay for a cent of it because I don't take insulin.  I am incredibly fortunate and have amazing insurance.  Being a union member I probably have the best you can have in the US.

Is there anyone that has gotten their insurance to pay for a CGM if you aren't on insulin?

If you are from another country than the US does your national health insurance pay for CGM if you don't take insulin?

It seems just plain stupid to me for insurance companies not to support something that could help prevent issues in the future - serious, costly issues.",3,0.81,8

I've been on metformin for a year or two now as well as a handful of other regulating drugs.  I also cut down my carb intake quite a lot.  Went from eating a lot of rice, pasta and bread to relatively little. Not keto but conscious. 

I haven't got constant issues with gas and gas pain but I do have recurring issues with gas and gas pain. And it's of a relatively new ""flavor"". Thy feel different than gas I've had before.  There can be a lot of building of gas, lots of burbling and bloat in the stomach, then belching or flatulence, a few minutes where it feels over, and then it starts again.  

I'm sure this is triggered by a new food sensitivity and I'm going to do an elimination diet to figure it out.  But what I want to know is whether you personally have experienced a new sensitivity after lifestyle change and medicine.  In particular something like... you used to eat a lot of white rice, then you stopped eating white rice, but then you ate it again once and it made you feel like I've felt.

I'm the one who cooks 90% of the food because I enjoy it and am looking for suggestions on cookbooks.  We meal plan together every week and while my brain says ""cook a bunch of veggies and put some meat or beans with it"", her brain likes to look at recipes and then we can put them on the recipe board on the fridge. It's just because it's easier for me to imagine how food comes together without a recipe.  


The metformin (almost 6 months later) is still causing her gastro problems and just for fun she also has IBS so basically its making her life miserable and yes she's on Extended release and the amounts, dosage and timing has all been adjusted to no avail.  PS: the metformin isn't really working to reduce her A1C and we are generally whole grain, veggie, meat bean eaters... so it's not like we are eating bowls of white pasta and PB&amp;J on wonderbread every day. We had to cut out eggs for a while as they were an IBS trigger for a bit but are now ok if well cooked.   So breakfast was oatmeal for a long while. 

ANYWAY So far I'm thinking about the America's Test Kitchen Diabetes Cookbook and the Instant Pot Diabetes Cookbook.  

Side note: because of her job, lunches are often the most difficult as she sometimes only has a 15 minute window to eat so things like salads can be tricky.  (She's a professor and sometimes her opportunity between classes is while walking from one class to the next) 

I'm excited to hear your suggestions.

I thought nothing of it and brushed my teeth again, the brush grashed over that same area by accident a few times and it felt tender. I thought it wouldnt be a big deal. Well...

Thursday morning I woke up to it being swollen and some of it overlapping on my wisdom tooth.

I called my dentist who said he didnt have apps for 3-4 weeks out. I scheduled the app and he said I could get antibiotics in the mean time.

I was already taking an antibiotic that was prescribed to me on 5/24/22 for an infected molar, it worked on the molar but it did not work on the gums, they remained swollen and got slightly bigger.

I finally broke down and went to the e.r. ***today*** because I am feeling not so great. I feel like my head has some extra pressure on it and like my throat is irritated. The pain on the gum when i chew (when i bute down the wisdom tooth squeeses down on the swollen gum thats on top of it) it hurts so i blended my breakfast this morning which was full of carbs :(

Im not on insulin yet. I feel worried this gum abraision is something my diabetes wont allow to heal and it could get worse.

I went to the e.r., showed the doctor my gums and asked for antibiotics. He got mad at me and said i need to have my wisdom pulled. I said i have a dental app soon can i have meds for now. He said since i already got prescribed meds and the gum issue didnt improve that i needed the tooth pulled. 

The non infected tooth. That seems crazy to me. He was pretty rude, terrible bedside manor. I was just shocked when he said this and he started saying ""why are you confused!? The meds wont do anything they wont fix the problem"".

I feel dismissed and also i have a speech impediment and adhd so i dont feel he understood the problem. Not sure what to do since the meds arent making the swelling go away and althought the pain is tolerable if i dont chew and stick to liquid meals its completely miserable.

About 6 weeks before that test I'd changed my diet- no red meat, pasta, rice or potatoes,no processed foods, lots of vegetables, legumes, nuts and chicken, and lowered carb intake. I started glucose testing right after the A1C alarm. Sorry... long explanation. 3 years ago I had my aortic valve replaced and a kidney removed so a lot of medications are off the table. Blood pressure and pulse are fine, EKG was normal when it was tested 2 weeks ago.

Dr started me on min. dose of Glipizide (5mg i think) and that made me lightheaded about 22 hours a day- no way I could even exercise. Stopped that after 2 bad weeks (dr said to stop).

Ok- here's what seems off to me: I'm lightheaded with glucose under about 115 and over 170ish means I'm dizzy with a headache. Exercise- within 15 minutes I get lightheaded to the point of passing out. Last time that happened glucose read 108. Taking a glucose tablet before exercise works but it doesn't seem healthy to do that longterm. Eating some protein and a piece of fruit before exercise did not work. 

On the opposite end, a small bowl of oatmeal and handful of blueberries shoots glucose up to 220, resulting in me feeling dizzy, a little disoriented then a headache then sleepy. From what I've read it seems like these numbers shouldn't result in these side effects-- is that right?

My OB is telling me I prob had high fasting glucose before I was pregnant, which means I was probably prediabetic. 

I knew this was a possibility that my previous GDM diagnosis uncovered but the news is still hitting me hard. I LOVE food. I LOVE cooking, and while there are a million delicious things that I can and do eat that wont negatively impact blood sugar, I cant help but feel panicky about the food I cant enjoy unabashedly. 

This is going to sound so cheesy, but what if I go on a dream trip to Italy? Can I not have pasta, followed by gelato?

What if Im at the best donut shop in America? Can I have that donut?

My other concern is the time commitment. Does managing your food get easier/more autopilot? The biggest thing I took away from my last pregnancy was how much time was spent thinking about and prepping food. It made food less enjoyable. This time, with a toddler to also handle, its even more of a time suck. 

Thanks in advance for hearing me out. Im in a panic, and no one on my side or my husbands side has T2 so I dont have anyone to relate to on this.",2,1,7
ReputedWasherOfRocks,2022-06-15,Expected glucose reading results in the beginning,"Hi, I was just diagnosed on June 1st 2022 with type 2, having a blood sugar level of 263/10.8 ac1. I immediately changed my eating habits and started walking most days after dinner (only about six-eight blocks, no big deal). My numbers started to drop right away and this morning I am already down to 118mg/dl 5.7 ac1 (and still dropping about eight-ten points per day). Is this normal and expected? I used to *really* enjoy my chocolate and snack cakes/midnight snacks and was probably the main cause for my 263 blood sugar level because I would really over indulge. Just wondering if this is how it was when anyone else first started off and if this is expected? I suspect that my doctor will be happy when I see him in a couple of weeks anyhow. Thanks",2,1,7

ButlerianJihadNOW,2022-06-15,Real Neuropathy vs Anxious Neuropathy,"Greetings everyone - I'm a ""new"" diabetic diagnosed in late 2018, and I've been really anxious about neuropathy lately. I'll be getting tested for it, but I won't be able to do that until I see my GP at the end of the month. I was wondering if it's possible to differentiate between anxiety-induced neuropathy symptoms and real neuropathy...

I've been going through a stressful series of events lately, outside of my health concerns, and tend to get pretty hypochondriac when my anxiety is high. I've had it happen in the past where I've worried myself into having symptoms of different maladies - that only get worse because I get anxious about them... only to be told via testing that nothing has been wrong. I'm not sure how to feel, but it seems like I can't trust my body's warning signs. Are there any aspects I should look for that would determine the state of my neuropathy? Or is it not possible to know until tests are done?...

It mostly manifests as occasional tingling in the feet (mostly in the toes) or hands, but last night I woke up with my right hand fully tingling and numb... Probably because I had slept on it and cut the blood flow by accident, but as of now it hasn't stopped tingling, fully. It's a lot weaker and in the bottom ""half"" of my hand (from ring and pinky finger to wrist) and a little ways down my arm. Does real neuropathy stay constantly? Or does it come and go? It probably doesn't help that my pulse has been through the roof this morning - over 100 - but my blood pressure is fine. Fasting blood sugar was over 110, though...

Looking at stories from here in other threads, it seems like people can get it at any stage of their diabetes. I thought that I most likely couldn't have it because I haven't been diabetic for that long, but this disease is experienced differently by everyone...",2,0.75,0
jerzeyguy101,2022-06-13,Test Strips and Medicare,"Just joined the Medicare crowd and went to pick up a refill for test strips. They had billed it out to my pervious insurer which expired May 31.  Pharmacist was checking me out and gave me quite a bit of a hassle saying I needed additional documentation to get test strips under Medicare.  I thought (and told him) that as long as my script indicated my diagnosis (T2) and was for 1 test strip per day - no additional documentation was required.  Then he started asking when I got my meter (3 months prior at his pharmacy).  All the time he was typing, typing and typing.  Finally, he says I'll process it this time but I could not do auto-renewals any longer 

Since this was my first Medicare B claim of any kind, I expected I would have to pay the full Medicare price since I did not meet the deductible yet.  But he charged me I think was just the 20%.  The paperwork just shows ""Medicare"" as the insurer.  So I wonder if this will actually go through Medicare.

Is it normal to provide documentation for just 1 strip per day?",2,0.75,4

Snoo_23157,2022-06-07,Impact of Statin on blood sugar?,"I was prescribed statin 2 years ago. After using it daily for a year, I developed multitude of side effects that I stopped it for about 6 months. My cardiologist scared me to restart it, but only after a few weeks of using it, the side effect returns, and I stopped again. One of the side effects seems to have manifested in high blood sugar, as shown by higher A1C (6.1) than previous years. At that time, I started doing intermittent fasting and low carb diet. 

Then 3 months ago, I started using Freestyle Libre CGM to learn how different activities affect my blood sugar. After using 3 sensors (not continuously), I pretty much know how my body behaves during various activities, and reacts to different kind of food.

On my 4th CGM, I decided to start taking statin again to see what it does to my blood sugar. And, whoa! The same night that I took the first statin, my CGM alarm woke me up, that my BG was at 226. From previous learning experience, I know that my BG should be between 120 and 90 when I sleep. Then the morning after, as I do my regular gym exercise, the Libre app again warned me that my BG was over 300, while usually my exercise only bring up my BGF between 120 to 150. Then came lunch and dinner (I skip breakfast as part of my IF), and my salad that usually barely bring up my BG to 130 was registered as over 200, and my normal dinner which normally would bring up my BG to 180, triggered high alert warning of 386. I was very concerned, so I did a finger prick 30 min later (I was in a restaurant and didn't bring it with me!) and it was at 110, while the CGM still reported 286. I was so confused. 

Is it possible that the CGM just suddenly went erratic at the same time I started taking Statin? Libre is good for 2 weeks, and I did my statin 10 days into the life to the CGM, and it behaved normally for 10 days, then right after I took statin, it reported crazy numbers during activities that normally reports normal higher number.  

My finger prick seems to confirm that my BG was actually ""normal"", so is statin only impacting the cell fluid that is being monitored by the CGM?

My appt w/ my doctor is sometimes in July, and I would certainly bring up this, but I am hoping that the community may have some collective knowledge that can shine some light to this experience.",2,1,5

I understand my doctor will know the answer better than anyone but I still would like some opinions on the matter. Previously I was taking Trulicity and Synjardy at the same time and my weight came down, my blood sugars in a good range, and my a1c at a near normal level. And so my doctor took me off Trulicity starting December 2021. But since then, I've gained some weight, my blood sugars still good, and my a1c up by 0.6.

While not big increases, personally the weight gain and the higher a1c made me pause for concern and I urged to go back to trulicity which they thankfully put me on. But at the cost of halfing my dose of synjardy which was 2x a day. The doctor's office was late to inform me on this and since I've been taking both 2x Synjardy and Trulicity my blood sugars have been lower than normal. But now that I'm only taking 1 synjardy in the AM, my PM readings have been higher and now I'm just questioning everything. 

I think I'm going to monitor my PM sugars but I dunno if Im just being impatient. I'd love some thoughts.",2,1,4

I have been on: metformin extended release, jardiance, rybelsus, Amaryl, trulicity and now I start Ozembic next week. I have had to stop many of these meds and try another due to the side effects of diarrhea or nausea, or limb numbness being so severe. Zofran does work for nausea, but not enough for me to function daily.

Not one of these meds has lowered my a1c. Rybelsus and trulicity did decrease my hunger, and I lost weight without trying, but the glycogen/ insulin output didn't seem to do jack or shit. During the 6 months of rybelsus I lost 20 lbs, but my a1c went from 7.6 to 9.1. My a1c is now 9.5.
My comprehensive blood, liver and kidney tests are always within normal ranges, every 6 months. My thyroid with t3 t4 is normal, cortisol was just checked and that's normal too. My diet and exercise have not changed. The only increased stress would be working during the pandemic in my lab job with no big breaks of rest. I work 40 hrs a week and I live alone, this has also been constant for 5 years.

My grandfather had Type 2 diabetes but only got it later in life and no one else in my immediate family, including cousins etc, have diabetes. However, I have no clue why I have had AN since I was a kid. Anyway, I saw that it is mostly associated with Type 2 and so I went to see an endocrinologist. He seemed quite unbothered by it, remarking that my fasting blood glucose was normal. But he said it was possible I may develop Type 2 later in life.

Now the thing is that I am a bit worried. I have a really bad anxiety disorder which contributes. But I was reading somewhere that if you are slender(which I am) and young and you are showing signs of diabetes then it's usually late onset type 1.

Ive struggled with my weight my entire life and seem to have a yo-yo effect with my weight. Throughout high school I was in decent shape and played lacrosse but even then my weight would greatly fluctuate. I finally lost weight enough to join the army and even asses successfully for a special operations unit and ran 5+ miles a day with monthly 12 mile ruck marches, despite doing all of that my weight still was super inconstant.

Ive been out of the army for 3 years now and since Ive gained 60 lbs. Ive felt depressed, and completely exhausted for no reason. Recently I went to the doctors office and found out that I had super low testosterone (168 ng/dl). And my a1c was 8.8. My doctors prescribed me testosterone injections of 100 mg per week and Im only one injection in and feel a massive difference already. Ive began working out every day and cleaning up my diet. Im currently a sheriffs deputy and sometimes its super hard to be consistent. I have a follow up for my a1c next week where I assume we will look at a game plan.

kjmacsu2,2022-05-22,Insurance Companies are Stupid (US),"Am I the only one frustrated that my insurance company won't cover my CGM?  I pay for it out of pocket and while it does cut into my budget more than I'd like, I'd rather give up other things to have it.

It has helped me more than my PC, my endo, and my dietician combined.  I was missing so many ""high"" points as my insurance only covered two blood strips a day.  Docs had me checking when I got up and before my last meal.  I thought I was doing good, but once I got the CGM I found out I was having some pretty big highs after breakfast and lunch but didn't see them.

The CGM has eliminated all that and really helped me see what I can tolerate and what I can't.  I already ate healthy before my diagnosis and was at a healthy weight.  It seems stupid to me for insurance companies not to pay for this since it can really help stop future complications by educating the diabetic.

I don't know what I'm trying to say.  I guess I'm just venting that my fun time money is now being spent on a sensor.  I know many people have it much worse and can't even afford it at all, but I still want to complain I guess.",35,0.95,27
gloricle,2022-06-06,A1c down from 7.2 to 6.2 after 6 months,"I had a A1c reading of 7.2 in December 2021.

Last week my blood was tested and I got my result today. Its at 6.2 now.

This is how I did it:

Cut down on carbs such as rice, noodles, bread. Cut them out by a lot. I still eat them but not as a staple.

Then, for the 1st half of April I got into the carnivore diet. Before adopting it, I read about it as much as I could. It made sense! [https://justmeat.co/](https://justmeat.co/)

After 2 weeks, I took a break - reasons: craving sugar, feeling lethargic, didnt want to buy smaller clothes. I was losing about 200-300g per day and I dont really enjoy clothes shopping.

Then in May, I gave it another go. I think this was the middle of May. Not quite sure.

I significantly increased my fat intake to help with satiety and to ease the sugar cravings. This also helped with energy levels. I also started drinking more beef bone broth. That stuff is gold!

So its now June.

Mental benefits:

Even though I have bipolar disorder type 1, my moods are more stable. I am emotionally stronger. Im more confident. Im less of a pushover. I speak up. Im happier.

Physical changes: My liver enzymes are good (previously had fatty liver). My LDL is slightly up, but that is nothing to worry about with a carnivore diet. Search for Dr Paul Mason on YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-nq60\_oEIc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-nq60_oEIc)

My doctor has given the green light to cease gliclazide. Im still on jardiance, januvia and metformin XR.

Hope this helps anyone wanting to get some better control of their T2D.

One more thing: drink lots of water!!",34,0.9,3
ArtyCatz,2022-05-23,A1C at 5.7 this week,"This is the second consecutive three-month check with a 5.7 result. I stopped taking Metformin a couple weeks before my last check, so this is my first A1C without Metformin since my diagnosis last July.

Average glucose was 117 for the 3-month period (same as my last check in February).

The doctor says Im doing well at managing things through diet and exercise, so I dont have to take meds, and I can wait 6 months for my next blood test.

I never imagined that I would come this far in such a short time when I was diagnosed last summer. I was freaked out and a little terrified, but I want to encourage folks who are feeling overwhelmed that things can turn around. 

I also know that Im capable of backsliding into old, unhealthy habits, so Im also posting this as a reminder to myself. Last summer my A1C was 7.1, my weight was 30 lbs. heavier, I was drinking at least 2 liters of Pepsi a day, and I had not been to the gym in almost two years.

She wanted me to bring my BG reading for the last week. I brought the last 2 weeks.  She goes over my meds, and then I show her my BG for the last 2 weeks.  She looks at it and says ""Your blood sugar has been in the double digits for the last 2 weeks? Whatever it is you're doing, keep doing it.""

Starfoxy,2022-05-31,Actually Sugar-Free Jello,"The pre-made jello cups are sugar free, but the 'sugar-free' gelatin powder mixes are full of maltodextrin which is a bummer. I've known right along that unflavored gelatin (eg Knox) is available but I was at a loss of how to flavor it, and at what ratios to make a palatable dessert. 

Then it hit me that I can just use those mio-type flavorings. After some experimentation I'm calling it a success. All the flavors I've tried have set just fine and my family says that eating it feels the same to them as regular jello. 

The basic recipe: is 1 cup water and 1 packet of knox gelatin powder. Heat half the water to boiling. Meanwhile sprinkle the powder over the other half of the water and let sit for at least 1 minute. Stir in the boiling water until gelatin powder is completely dissolved. Then add mio to taste. Pour into serving dish or cups and place in fridge until set.

This sets up quite firmly so if you like your gelatin to be a bit softer/looser then add more water (I personally prefer it at about 1 1/8 cup water to 1 packet of gelatin. 

For deciding how much mio to add, you should just taste it. Yeah it's warm and weird but it's really the only way to tell if you've flavored it enough. Also, it's better build up to the right amount of flavoring. It's much more complicated to fix it when you've overdone it. 

I like to make a quadruple batch, and flavor it after I've poured it out into serving cups so that I can have a few different flavors available at the same time without making a bunch of smaller batches.",32,1,10

I searched on this, and apparently it's a thing for type 2 diabetics who are not on insulin (although not generally recommended for newly diagnosed diabetics).

My next test was 4 months or so later, and the result was an a1c of 5.4, so apparently what I am doing is working.

BatonPantheon,2022-05-29,RANT: Ozempic shortage in Australia.,"Warning: There's really no point to this post except to get an immense frustration off my chest, so if you're not really into that thing....well, you've been warned.

So for those not in the know, Australia is currently experiencing a nationwide shortage of Ozempic, which I've been on for several months (along with a whole cocktail of other medications). As most of you probably know however, one of unintended but extremely positive side effects of Ozempic is that it's almost as effective as bariatric surgery for weight loss, and currently twice as effective as any weight loss medication currently on the market. Naturally, people who are looking to lose a bit of weight (even if they're not diabetic) are swarming to these online GP's (family medicine doctor to my American friends) who see patients exclusively online and WITHOUT EVEN ASKING ABOUT THEIR PERSONAL HISTORY, are just handing out prescriptions for Ozempic to them. No vetting, no questions asked. 

What. The. Fuck. 

Now I get it. As a chonky boy myself (I fluctuate between 95-100 kg or 210 to 220 pounds) I can appreciate that weight loss is not easy and it fucking sucks that the world treats fat people so differently (i.e WORSE) but the large percentage of us who actually use Ozempic for it's intended purpose use it because we are SICK. My blood sugar being out of control is KIND OF A MORE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM than you wanting to shed a few kilos. Not to mention that obesity and T2D so often go hand in hand. 

Every single pharmacy I have called is out of stock. None of them know when stock is coming back in. I literally had to put my name down on a waiting list at my local chemist. Story after story is coming out now of fellow Australian T2D having to literally ration their Ozempic because who the fuck knows when they're gonna get more. I only have 2-3 more doses in the pen that's currently in my fridge. 

The worst part of it all? NONE OF THIS SHIT IS ILLEGAL. Immoral obviously, but not illegal. So there's literally nothing we can do. Great.

I see my GP in a week or so and I was planning to ask her to put me on Trulicity instead but I don't know...from what I've heard, it isn't as effective as Ozempic.

Well, here I am at home eating at ketogenic levels of low carb, and taking my meds, and my blood sugar has been improving slowly.  Even my fasting blood glucose is in the 80s. Sometime, around 9:00 PM it will dip to 75-78 and then an hour later bounce back up to 90-91.

I know that eating salad w/ chicken breast for lunch would elevate my BG to about 140, and dinner such as potato/rice + meat/veggies would elevate my BG to 150-180.  Eating nuts (almond/pecan/walnut/cashew) only elevate my BG to about 130. Resistance trainings raise my BG to 130, aerobic exercise (running/elliptical) - 150+.

This morning I pushed myself a bit harder, and the CGM registered 182. Which is about as high as after a decent meal for dinner.

My understanding is that when BG gets elevated, pancreas would release insulin to signal the liver and cells to store/absorb the glucose.  I know that this is true when the glucose comes from food we eat. But what happen when the elevated glucose does not come from the stomach/food, but rather from the stored glucose in the liver?",8,0.91,12

I got into CrossFit because I had super high and uncontrolled blood pressure. My weight loss stalled for a year or two, but I was building muscle so I thought that was fine. I kept struggling with dehydration which lead to me getting blood work and discovering that my fasting blood sugar was 350 and my A1C was 14. I was put on Metformin, Ozempic, and Insulin at bedtime. 

I do have a family history of diabetes, both my parents have it and all of their siblings have it. So I knew I would end up with it at some point. But they werent diagnosed until their late 50s so I thought I had time. They are also both on Metformin only. 

I was really upset to be put on insulin and in 3 weeks I have my fasting blood sugar down to 150. I have also lost 10 pounds already. I havent been able to CrossFit in the last few weeks because I get false lows and have been feeling pretty crummy. 

I am still really struggling with how to deal with this. I feel kind of hopeless when I think about this disease long term. I am also not really telling people because I feel embarrassed.

Still, a few things stuck out that I'm looking for notes/feedback on. Or just venting on. I'm frustrated.

1. I asked for a male hormone panel, due to a) the general lack of energy that I blamed on being a fat-ass and covid-depressed and b) chronic ED that's been getting worse for years. All of my markers are worse than they were a few years ago - all of them within a few points ""too low"". But because they are all still barely in the range, she said they were ""normal"".
2. My Testosterone Bioavailable was 103, which is actually below the 110 is the bottom, but they were quick to say this wasn't a good indicator. Not that I'm necessarily looking for hormones, but it seems like my T trending down is bad?
3. Tri's were high, so Doc says cut back on fats. Then glucose is too high, so cut back on carbs. Oh and there's protein in your urine, careful with the protein intake. What's left, sunshine?
4. Last time I visited she said start walking as an exercise. I walk like 5-6 times a week now. Now they say ""we don't consider walking exercise."" WTF.

Glittering-Ear-2150,2022-06-15,"Hi, Im a young recently diagnosed diabetic who wants to be a doctor","Im 22 and recently diagnosed with diabetes. Still a recent diagnosis (2 weeks) and health care team is in the process of sussing out t1d vs t2d& originally suspected t1d but more labs are now raising suspicion for t2. This is my first Reddit post and Im not sure exactly what Im looking for from it  Encouragement? Advice? Judgement? Maybe just words from a community that may understand what Im going through. I am a pre-med right now, just graduated last year and am working my butt off to build a solid foundation and gain experience in a field Im passionate about. I am a healthcare professional and without a doubt knew what my labs meant when I got them. A HbA1c of 10.4% and glucose of 315. I was on a water break when these results came through and in the most nonintentionally dramatic way, spit out my water. It felt like my world just froze. Id always felt strong and healthy although I was overweight (Ive lost 15 lbs in the last year but had normal labs even when I was heavier). I grew up an athletic kid and have always had a busy schedule. Participate in HIIT and strength training workouts 3 times a week and my schedule requires me to be on my feet and walking around for 10-12 hrs a day. My diet is usually where I falter and I take complete responsibility of that, but Ive been cutting carbs over the last year (one of the ways I lost the weight, along with intermittent fasting). I have a family history of diabetes  both my maternal grandparents have type 2, and I always had a sneaking suspicion I was predisposed to diabetes (Im South Asian, and I also had acanthosis nigricans on the back of my neck since middle school). I think Im telling you this because I feel like its relevant in some way. I havent told anyone about my diagnosis except my partner of 8 years and my closest cousin. I spent the first 24 hours in a complete state of depression, and now all I feel is anger with myself and shame. I wish there wasnt a stigma around t2d and I wish I wasnt contributing to it by verbalizing my shame rn. I want to be able to write about this experience and my story in my med school apps but am worried about judgment from the ad coms. How do I tell them that I wholeheartedly know what it feels like now to place my life and care in the hands of my health care team, and how that has completely broken down new walls for my wanting to be a doctor? Or how my mom used to scrub the back of my neck raw with alcohol pads, thinking my acanthosis nigricans was a result of my lack of hygiene  (just one example of why health education is so necessary) yet Im scared and ashamed to tell her about my recent diagnosis. I desperately want to challenge the stigma surrounding younger generations of Americans living with diabetes just so I can feel ok, as if that would fix all my troubles. This was a long post but just a fraction of what Ive been feeling. I hope Im coming off as genuine  Im feeling very vulnerable and awkward right now.

Former-Anxiety-7125,2022-06-09,Keto vs Low carb vs Paleo,"Hi everyone! Im a recently diagnosed T2D. And I am trying to figure out what I should do about my diet. Since being diagnosed, the only carbs Ive been consuming have been oats, quinoa and whole vegetables. Proteins have been lean meats and fish. And fats have been nuts, avocado oil and animal fats. Its been about a month and a half since I was diagnosed and my readings have been sub 100mg/dL consistently. My doctor even took me off glipizide because my blood sugar was dropping too low and now Im just taking 500mg of Metformin twice daily. Ive also lost ~30lbs in this time. 

So when I went to the endocrinologist and dietician and I was told that I should eat more carbs I was concerned. Personally Im leading more towards a low carb or Keto diet. Ideally Id like to slowly decrease my carbs so eventually I would just be eating whole vegetables and lean meat. But through research Ive seen that the best diet for diabetics is keto and that the blood glucose spikes are due large in part to the carbs we consume, grains and other processed sugars. 

I eat about 130-140g of carbs per day but my doctor wants me to eat much more. All of this information is conflicting and confusing quite frankly and Id just like to hear from new and experienced diabetics what has been their diet journey and what they recommend.",8,1,14

Yes I am overweight but I didnt even know I was Pre-diabetic.

Im taking 850mg of Metformin and check my blood sugar levels here and there and its always in a good range. Tomorrow I have blood work and Im concerned I might have hypertension bc Ive gone in for a check up and twice my blood pressure has been high. Normal yet high enough to be concerned. I hope its just due to me not having been sleeping well because of college.

ninjabaker04,2022-06-08,Newly diagnosed - some questions,"Hi everyone, 

On 29.04.2022, I was diagnosed with T2D with a HBA1C of 11.7%. Since then I have been using a CGI (Freestyle Libre 3) and have also lost about 10KGs. I am also on Metformin 2000mg per day.

I have two questions: 

* In the morning, my fasting blood glucose level is generally below 100mg/dl (80-90) between 06:00 - 08:00 am. However, when I wake up and I am still fasting, it starts to rise above 100 and lingers around there (up till 105 mg/dl) - I am not sure how to explain this. Anybody has experienced this?
* Second question: today I decided to do a HBA1C test, which is around 6 weeks (45 days) after my last test and the HBA1C dropped from 11.7% to 7.9%. I was hoping for it to be a bit lower to be honest but at this rate, 7.9% is something I'll take. That being said, I understand that it is generally recommended to do a test after every 3 months, is that the reason why it is still high? Reason I am asking is because my CGI ""estimates"" based on my levels over the last 14 days that it should be around 5.8%.

Im-Not-Australian,2022-06-01,Terrified I have type 2 diabetes in remission,"So a bit of backstory. My dad has type 2. He's had it since 40 or 39. I've been massively overweight. 312lbs at my biggest in my early 20s and had been gaining weight since maybe 12. But I was never like him. At the time he had a big, hard gut. I've always had a wide flabby one. He looked almost skinny besides the huge gut. But in my mid 20s I started to lose weight and I was jogging every day. I got down to 180. At that point I had an a1c, which came back fine. No diabetes. A couple years later I started drinking, probably caused by depression from always worrying about my health, and gained nearly all the weight back. 280 or thereabouts. Later on I once again started losing weight and I'm now at 220. Six months ago I drank a whole bunch of diet soda one night (maybe 7 of those half bottles) and just started pissing like a fiend. I got scared and did what I always do and tasted it for sugar, and for the first time ever it tasted a little sweet. Even though it was soda with no sugar I lost my mind and went a week barely eating. I missed two days in a row at one point. After that hell week I worked up the nerve to get a fasting test, and was shocked when they said my blood sugar was slightly lower than normal. I was certain I had it. But I accepted the results. But now I've gotten back into googling and I've discovered that type 2 can go into remission with weight loss. My question is how likely is it that I might have it in remission? At the time of the great diet soda freakout I was eating fast food most of the time and snacking on reese's more than I want to admit, and not exercising at all. It was only that one week that I barely ate from stress. Is it possible it went down to slightly below normal in that time? Is it possible that I've had diabetes for 10+ years and just happened to be in remission during the a1c and the later fasting test?

Hopefully someone can answer this. I'm going nuts

vandar2659,2022-06-02,What is a reasonable increase in blood sugar?,"I want to get opinion regarding the BS elevation I'm seeing and whether or not it is significant.

I'm 31M diagnosed about 6 months ago with 8.4 A1C. 40.1 BMI obese.

With my current diet, my increase in BS post meal is usually around 5\~27 mgdl. When I eat high carb foods, the spike goes up to 40. I'm wondering if those spikes of around 20\~40 is is reasonable and should not make me worried.

Since last week I stopped taking my medications all together just check if I can control my sugar levels with diet and exercise alone. While taking medications (metformin ER) I can go around 85\~92mg/dl easily for fasting/pre meal and around 98\~103mg/dl post meal. I'll hit the 120+ values when eating badly like burger, meal with rice and desserts such as cakes or ice cream but nothing over 130.

Now that I've stop taking medication on 5/22, I was expecting slight increase in BS. My fasting for the past 10 days was around 87\~96mg/dl. After meals I get 99\~117. I tested more often than I was when taking medications to make sure I'm not going beyond my target ranges.

Fasting or pre meal Target: 80\~95

What I can tell so far based on the readings is that my fasting is slightly elevated. The spikes looks relatively the same to me.

Former-Anxiety-7125,2022-05-30,Symptoms,Hi just recently diagnosed with T2. Has anyone experienced any circulation issues. Ive noticed when I sit a certain way for not that long or lay down. I get sort of tingly in different places on my body. Its not painful or anything and no loss of sensation. Just mild tingling. Wondering if anyone has experienced the same. Thanks!,3,1,3
Borguschain,2022-05-30,Just recently been diagnosed T2,"Hi all, I've (M41) just been recently diagnosed T2, my fasting BGL was 21.6!

I'm off to a clinic tomorrow to start on insulin injections, already been prescribed Metformin 1000mg once a day. 

Had the usual upset stomach on the tabs for a few days, but what can I expect, side affects wise with the injections?

My GP has already told me to keep something sweet on me, in case of a hypo.

Sorry for the vague post, still getting my head around all of this.",3,0.81,17

Hickoryapple,2022-06-06,"BG is good, but doc want to up metformin/use Ozempic to lose weight again?","Was diagnosed with type 2 about a year ago, lost 10kg while on 500mg metformin a day, and 45mins moderate (mild hilly) walking most days. All numbers are good throughout the day, and if I eat something I know will be bad for the BG I'll do 20mins on the static bike to avoid it.

Then came a second covid lockdown around Oct (?), no daily walks, Xmas, bad weather, etc since then. Carbs amount crept up, but still restrained compared to pre diagnosis and much better carb choices than before.

Well. Check in with doc today, all weight has gone back on, she wants me to go to 1000mg daily, and use Ozempic (which is out of stock atm) and inject it myself weekly. What??!! I'm a big medical baby, don't think I could do that.

Why is she obsessed about my losing weight if my BG are good? And if my BG is balanced at 500mg, won't 1000mg be too much?",2,1,17
Im-Not-Australian,2022-06-03,Testing my BS at home because I can't afford a doctor,"So I am not diagnosed diabetic but I'm worried because I'm 220lbs, 34yrs old, and my dad is type 2. I got a couple of meters and tested after an 8hr fast. Got 85-91 on both meters. I tested again forty minutes after eating three helpings of regular Cheerios and just the one bowl of milk. This time I was at 150-160. I just retested at an hour and got around 140-145.

Is this normal or do I have prediabetes or perhaps diabetes? Any help is appreciated. I don't know anything about this and the internet is very vague.

Edit: I appreciate all the help and info. I think I don't have diabetes. I've written everything down over two meals, one of them fairly large, and will show them to a doctor if I ever get the chance to see one. But it seems okay according what charts and Mayo Clinic say it should be. You guys are troopers for putting up with those ridiculous test strip costs.",1,0.56,44

funsk8mom,2022-05-29,Trulicity questions,"I was Dx in February 2020. In late April 2020 I started trulicity and over the 2 years I was on, increased to 3.0 (my bs was 7.0 when I started)

I recently stopped taking it. I felt like it was no longer working, had my full appetite back, stopped losing weight (lost 30lbs) and didnt want to keep wasting money on something that wasnt working. I dont see my endo until September. 

My question is, if Im off of it for 4/5 months and my endo wants me to go back on, will it help my weight loss again?",2,1,5

Lost-Cc,2022-06-18,Freak?,"Greetings. I was diagnosed in 2017 after 5 years of undiagnosed IBS-D with an a1c of 6.8 after controlling with diet best to my abilities with non-FODMAP aggravating foods, and walking 4 miles every day at work, my diabetes has worsened continually. 

I have been on: metformin extended release, jardiance, rybelsus, Amaryl, trulicity and now I start Ozembic next week. I have had to stop many of these meds and try another due to the side effects of diarrhea or nausea, or limb numbness being so severe. Zofran does work for nausea, but not enough for me to function daily.

Not one of these meds has lowered my a1c. Rybelsus and trulicity did decrease my hunger, and I lost weight without trying, but the glycogen/ insulin output didn't seem to do jack or shit. During the 6 months of rybelsus I lost 20 lbs, but my a1c went from 7.6 to 9.1. My a1c is now 9.5.
My comprehensive blood, liver and kidney tests are always within normal ranges, every 6 months. My thyroid with t3 t4 is normal, cortisol was just checked and that's normal too. My diet and exercise have not changed. The only increased stress would be working during the pandemic in my lab job with no big breaks of rest. I work 40 hrs a week and I live alone, this has also been constant for 5 years.

Am I a freak in this category (?) I can't find any info about diabetes drugs not working *at all* on a1c and glucose, just people finding they stop working as well as they used to. Am I just doomed to insulin or WTF? Any ideas? Thanks",2,1,6

DX2isDD,2022-06-14,Just went to 6.8. Ugh.,"After a few years of being about 40 pounds overweight I just went to 6.8 as my doctor was watching it. Im exercising now, eating less, eating healthy etc but just started a month ago. Im upset since this is a permanent diagnosis. I know I can control it and reverse it but I now have crossed the rubicon I thought I wouldnt go over. I was more worried about heart disease and breast cancer (parents had these). Anyhow I just had to rant knowing its not reversible and Im pissed at myself. Any pearls of wisdom or hopeful suggestions on how to reverse this besides the obvious?",1,1,7

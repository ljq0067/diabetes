seashe11y,2024-07-04,T1 16yo son is rebellious and doesnt take his insulin. Pretty sure he has ketones. What should I do?,"He was just diagnosed a few months back and Im very new to this so please be nice. Im worried for him. He turned off his dexcom but before he did, it was riding 400+ and I was reminding him to take his insulin. I try very hard not to nag him. I dont try to control what he eats, I just expect him to take his insulin in his own as his dr told me to do. But he hasnt and hes been staying cranky, extra hot and sluggish since schools been out. Im pretty sure he hasnt taken his long acting in a very long time. I think he may be getting close to DKA but I really dont know. Hes been pushing his limits since his diagnosis and wont pee on the ketones stick. Hes way bigger and taller than me so I cant just pick him up and take him anywhere. I need advice. Thank you ",46,0.96,69,pee
stevebobeeve,2024-07-03,Does anyone have experience with their dog alerting them to low bg?,"So last night I woke up at 2:00am because my dog was scratching at my door. This isnt all that unusual. Usually it either means she needs to be let out to go pee or she wants me to let her up in my bed with me.

I let her out in the yard to do her thing but realized I was feeling woozy so I checked and my bg was down to 26. Had I let it go much longer it could have been a bad situation. 

I have had incidents like this before. Even times when my sugar was so low my muscles seized up and I couldnt move. Every time it happens my mother goes on about how the dogs were acting strangely and trying to get her attention.

Ive always found these claims a bit dubious because its more likely they just read my expression and realized I wasnt normal. As for last night, the dog couldnt have known anything was wrong because I was in a room behind a closed door.

So Im just curious if any of you have had this happen, where a pet alerted either you or someone else that your sugars were low. Or has there been any scientific study on this effect?",26,1,33,pee
wikedsmaht,2024-06-22,Talk me though how you put your CGM and infusion site on your butt& without constantly ripping them off ,"I usually plug in my cyborg attachments to my stomach or upper arms (but have also used my thighs, while pregnant). I have tried putting them on my upper butt / muffintop, but always rip everything out when I go pee in a hurry while pulling by drawers up and down. 

Ill be going on vacation soon and I want to not have my stuff on my stomach. Ill be wearing a 2pc bathing suit and swimming, snorkeling, etc and am worried about shit getting dislodged. So& butt? Any advice?",18,0.96,14,pee
albhefpf,2024-07-04,What to expect after DKA?,"39F I was in the ICU with DKA and released three days ago. They ran the protocols and did all the IVs. I was in the ICU for three days and regular stay for one day. My glucose was 600 and A1c was 12.3, unexpectedly, having doubled within six months. Im newly diagnosed and never had any indication of diabetes. Not even 100% sure if I have type one because those tests have yet to be done. 

The main symptoms went away with the IVs and they said I was stable enough to go home. But my blood sugar was still fluctuating between 200 in the morning and 300 after meals. Ive been peeing on ketone sticks at home and its still showing the highest ketones. 

At the hospital, they gave me what I assumed were the correct life-saving fluids, but the rest of the care was not helpful and Im home now but very scared. I was sent home with three units of fast acting in 12 units of long acting insulin. 

I spoke to a primary care provider who outwardly admitted she knows zero about DKA. They told me I have to wait until after July 4 to call and ask the insurance for an emergency endocrinologist appointment. in the meantime, Im trying to educate myself to remain stable until I can get more labs done. 

Im following instructions very carefully and eating very healthy. However my glucose is between 200 - 300, I still feel very weak. Im still peeing all the time. The ketone strip is showing the highest level of ketones. I also have access to my electronic records and I saw that my anion gap was back to 14 after I was off the IVs.

I dont think going back to the hospital is the answer because I felt rather unsafe there. I had to beg them to bring me my food within 2 hours of meal time and the food they were giving was so unhealthy. It also took many days of asking to get a doctor to talk to me and look at me in the face and review my chart and tell me what was happening. 

Im assuming my numbers arent going to normalize immediately and I might as well keep monitoring and stay at home where I can at least get normal food. 

For those who experience DKA, Im curious how long it took for your numbers to normalize and what were some aftercare instructions you received, while you waited to see another doctor? ",2,1,3,pee
RubyCatharine,2024-06-12,Sickness kicking my butt,"Even COVID did not kick my butt this hard. Ive got a fever that migrates between 99-101 throughout the day. My nose is clogged. My head hurts. I just want to sleep. Im not nauseous or vomitting but Im not hungry either. Ive eaten like twice since being sick. My throat hurts. I cant stop coughing or sneezing.

And then we have the ketones! I dont have a blood meter only urine sticks but its been reading moderate~large since 1am yesterday so almost 24 hours. 2 days before that I was also getting some large readings, but theyd go back down fairly quickly with insulin. Every 2 hours Im giving myself insulin, though my blood sugar will not go below 200.

I called my doctor and she just told me to keep doing it since Im not exhibiting any DKA symptoms. I just ended up in the hospital in DKA a couple months ago due to a kinked canula or something and I have it burned into my memory still exactly how it felt. I had some cramping in my stomach yesterday, but again none of the nausea or unable to stop throwing up that I felt. I can get up to use the bathroom, which I also couldnt do when I was in DKA. (My balance is a little off when walking but I think thats the fever/headache tbh). The ketones are just stressing me out because Im scared Ill go to sleep and wake up in DKA or something to the point Ive been waking myself up every 2 hours which probably isnt helping my rest or recovery.

In all honesty I probably am not drinking enough water. I think I drank like one water bottle today, and while I have been able to pee every 2 hours it isnt a lot. 

Im just super stressed out about this whole thing but my parents are super anti ER especially if Im not exhibiting DKA symptoms like I was 2 months ago (no nausea/vomiting, confusion, being super off balance/dizzy, weird breathing, unable to be roused). 

I guess Im just ranting because even COVID wasnt this bad. I made it through my week of COVID with no ketones and now Ive had them for 24 hours straight (~3 days on and off) and its just frustrating. Also my sisters 8th grade graduation is tomorrow and Im probably not going to make it because of this and that makes me sad/frustrated. Also def going to have to reschedule the dentist appointment for Friday that Ive been waiting since March for.

In slightly good news, my blood sugar usually runs far too high because of anxiety about lows so the 200s are actually lower than normal and I feel proud about that if nothing else.",2,1,0,pee
scoodine,2024-06-18,Type 1 Metformin Questions ,"So, thanks to you all I went from undx'd and in DKA to 12.9 a1c to an estimated 6.9 a1c and 88% TIR as a nearly 30 year old Type 1/Lada in just a few months. Thank you all for your support and kindness, first of all. e

Before DX I was on Metformin and it was super helpful in managing PCOS so they just put me back on it. I'm not having any of the typical digestive symptoms, and my TIR has been almost 99% over the last 3 days, with an average of 110. I have an almost flat line on my Dexcom, even after meals. It's been eerily nice and I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop!

Here's my side effects: excessive night sweats, the need to pee often, and higher bg between 2am and 4am. It has only been about 170 at the highest in spikes throughout the night, but before I always had a flat line when I slept. Last night I went to bed at 103, and set my alarms super loud bc I was scared of nighttime lows, and it DID alarm... At 185! For three hours, despite a correction - my first time spent over 180 in three days. It finally dropped to like 170 at 4am and then the minute my feet hit the floor it was 125, right where I expect it to be. I've never had Dawn Phenomenon without the Metformin... Could it be something else? I don't know how I correct for that if I'm going to bed on the low end? The wild thing is that my omnipod stopped my basal during that period and I don't know why bc I was clearly in need of it?

I'm also a little worried about night sweats and the need to pee all the time, as those were side effects of DKA for me as well... 

Any thoughts appreciated! e",1,0.67,4,pee

verytinyrodent,2024-06-20,horrible things that happened while i had diabulimia,"i (23F) had diabulimia from ages 17-22 and it basically destroyed my life. i was hospitalized 3 times, one of those because of severe DKA that landed me in the ICU. i've been in recovery for a little over a year but still find myself slipping, so i thought i'd make a list of all the side effects of diabulimia i experienced to remind myself why recovery is so worth it. i saw someone else post on here about their experience and it really helped me snap back into a recovery mindset. if you have also struggled/are currently struggling with diabulimia, i hope this helps you in your own recovery, wherever you are in the process.

* constant fatigue. i couldn't make it through the day without at least 3 naps and my social life suffered. i also got inconsistent sleep because of how much i was waking up in the middle of the night to pee
* INTENSE STOMACH PAIN to the point of not being able to stand up straight or even walk for hours after i ate
* i was so dehydrated my lips/gums were bleeding. the corners of my mouth split open and didn't heal until i was in recovery. i went to the dentist and they had to put vaseline on my cracked lips because they kept splitting when i opened my mouth wide. my mouth was also constantly dry so my breath stank!!!
* my hair fell out and it hasn't been the same since, still patchy in some places
* my nails would flake off and were so thin they were literally flexible
* the brain fog!!!! i have almost no memory from those years and especially none from the 6 months my diabulimia was at its worst
* yeast infections. i basically had a constant one for two years because of how high my sugars were. it was uncomfortable and made me feel gross.
* UTI-like symptoms that were not cured with UTI medication. this happened to me twice where i had burning and painful sensations while peeing. it got so bad that i couldn't get off the toilet because i had no bladder control and had to go to the ER
* peeing in general... a lot... multiple times per hour. horribly inconvenient and genuinely embarrassing at times...
* ALWAYS HUNGRY but never feeling full. one time i ate an entire frozen pizza, a pint of ice cream, and three grilled cheeses all in one sitting and was still craving more even though i was physically uncomfortable from eating so much
* i didn't shit for 2 weeks straight because of how dehydrated i was. i was doubled over in stomach cramps/nausea nonstop, taking laxatives and stool softeners, and nothing helped
* severe bloating after eating, so much so that i had to change into loose pants after i ate. because of my body dysmorphia, this was one of the worst parts of having diabulimia. my stomach would change size so dramatically throughout the day that my body image only got worse, no matter what my weight was at, thus the cycle continued
* inability to focus. i failed two quarters of college and had to withdraw after being hospitalized for the first time. i had no energy to spend on school and the periods of blurry eyesight i would also experience definitely didn't help
* i was a completely different person. i don't remember much but i know i'm much more mentally stable and coherent now. i remember being very volatile, depressed, and anxious. i would cry constantly and could not regulate my emotions at all. i also had no sex drive or hobbies. 
* never healed from any bruise/scrape/injury and was CONSTANTLY sick. even if it was the smallest cold, it completely took me out. 
* DRY SKIN. SO DRY. my hands/elbows were always peeling and no amount of moisturizer could stop it. 
* i lost/damaged a lot of relationships. my (now ex) boyfriend and i broke up because he couldn't stand watching me slowly kill myself and not do anything about it. my parents don't trust me like they used to because i would lie to them about my insulin use. my friends walked on eggshells around me because they never fully understood what was going on. 

i'm sure there's a lot more that i'm missing but i genuinely hope this is meaningful to at least one person who comes across it. looking back on this list and what i was okay with putting my body through for the sake of losing weight is really a huge wake up call. life without these symptoms is *actually* living &lt;3",91,0.96,16,pee
disco-ballerina,2024-06-05,Sister rarely below 200,"My little sister was diagnosed a year ago at age 11. 
I am a user on the dexcom app and see that she is rarely below 200. 
I am older and have been trying to help as much as I can. My mom tries her best but I think the doctors arent giving her the best information based off of other conversations on here.  
The doctors told her not to worry about being high, just worry about the lows so she keeps her high all the time to avoid the lows. 
Is this normal? Or should I be concerned? 
Also my sister doesnt have any effects when her sugar is high, she doesnt get thirsty or have to pee a lot so it doesnt bother her at all. 
Thanks for your help. ",36,0.91,88,pee
Mtg-2137,2024-06-04,Awesome gift I got while in Finland,"I live in the USA and we have friends and relatives on my moms side of the family that live over in Finland. One of them is a nurse for Type 1 Diabetic teens and as I was sick over there recently she was really shocked to learn that a lot of Americans still pee on sticks to check for ketones. The device in this photo uses the same process for checking blood sugars in order to check for ketones and its WAY more accurate. =

LarryStylinson05,2024-06-10,New job ,"Hello everyone. I (19F) have just started a new job at a cafe. 3 days a week, 4-6 hour long shifts. I have worked at McDonalds and other cafes before. 

If my level is high during my shift, I got to the bathroom 1-2 times an hour, but if I do insulin (even just a TINY BIT) my level drops really quickly, (because Im on my feet and rushing around the whole shift) and I go low, and have to sit down and eat for 15-20 minutes.

My manager complained to me on my latest shift that I left the floor too often. Meaning going to the bathroom to use the toilet, and doing insulin in the bathroom. 

If I dont do insulin, Im high and need to pee a lot. If I do some insulin, my level will drop and Ill end up spending more time treating my low. 

The cafe only has 2-3 people on at the front + 1 chef out the back in the kitchen. So when theres only 2 people on, so if I leave, the other person will be alone. 

Please just ANY ADVICE =-=-! 


TL;DR &gt; manager at new cafe job doesnt like me leaving the floor to 1. Treat lows, 2. Go to the toilet (when Im high), 3. To do insulin. ",3,1,8,pee
Thunderfury1208,2024-06-12,Needing Advice,"My 6 year old son recently went to the pediatrician and they tested his urine. They said his protein count was high so they wanted us to test his urine again to double check his count. Today we got informed he still had a high protein count. They want to test his kidney to make sure he doesn't have CKD. Symptoms he's shown are Constantly saying he's thirsty , he drinks Alot of water or juices. He says he's hungry and eats all the time . He has stunted growth and were advised he is 4-5 inches shorter than where he's supposed to be. He is underweight by 30 lbs and again he eats Alot breakfast snacks lunch snacks and dinner like many kids. I haven't noticed any foamy peeing but doctors want to test his kidneys to make sure he doesnt have CKD. None of my grandparents or my ex wife's or each other have had kidney issues in it families.

Can this be treated for such a young age ? They also believe he may have issues with his GH due to the symptoms. He runs plays and eats like any other kid. What are the chances this really is CKD.. PLEASE advise in just not in a good state of mind right now and am worried for my son.",1,0.67,9,pee
ItsOnlyMe07,2024-06-30,Can you be diabetic with normal HbA1C?,"I have family history of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.  I have my HbA1C checked regularly and it always comes back completely normal.  

However, in the last few months I've been very thirsty, getting tired a lot of the time, waking in the night to pee, and peeing lots in the day.  I've also had really frequent infections so my GP is looking into the possibility of an autoimmune condition.  

When I took oral steroids for a chest infection my blood sugar shot right up and made me feel really unwell.  Mouth so dry my gums stuck to my teeth etc. 

Even a while later I'm still having similar symptoms and my fasting glucose is around 8mmol/L which is slightly higher than it should be.

Last week my GP did my HbA1C again but it just came back as normal so I'm really confused.  Can anyone shed some light?",0,0.5,30,pee

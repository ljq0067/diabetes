houseofmyth,2022-05-20,"Who here takes medication for anxiety, depression, other mental disorders?","(22F/Reactive Hypoglycemia) I haven't been on psychiatric medication since my diagnosis, but I see a psychiatrist next week. I know that some prescription medication can affect blood glucose. If you take this kind of medication, which meds work for you and your blood sugar levels? Did you ever take meds that dangerously impacted your blood sugar? What else should I know about taking psych meds with glycemic issues?


(Obviously everyone is different- I'm aware that a safe medication for one individual may cause another individial a bad reaction. Just thought I'd ask, so I can have some info before my appointment. Thanks for reading!)

EDIT: I'm diagnosed with anxiety, depression, OCD, PTSD and they've suspected BPD in the past but hadn't diagnosed it yet. Just to give you an idea of what meds they might recommend to me.",7,0.75,17
Harambe1983,2022-05-12,"Muscle twitches but no pain, could it be electrolytes?","Since everyone here is diabetic, I want to ask. Did any of you have muscle twitches (0 pain). The twitches is not powerful enough to move limbs, its usually like pulse. Its random in arms/thigh/part of legs etc. usually last less than a minute. Comes and goes. Mostly while resting.      And if you do, how many of you are on low carb diet when this starts?    I am suspecting electrolyte imbalance (calcium/pottasium/magnesium/sodium). Seems like too much or too little or imbalance of one to another cause it. Seems that low carb diet makes us flush water and without glycogen to store water, we lose electrolytes quickly.      My suspicion is because my a1c was 9 for years, then I went low carb and get it to 6.3, now that Im 8-9months in, twitching starts.  The timing is what makes me suspect the diet/electrolytes is causing it.  (I do supplement electrolytes)",9,0.92,17
Suitable-Regular8813,2022-05-23,My Mom and Sister arent serious about diabetes,"Ever since Mom got diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, both my Mom and Sister have taken a laissez faire with managing and learning. I am the only one even seriously learning and researching about diabetes, caring for a parent, diet, etc. Yet, we didnt start caring for my Mom immediately. We still eat white rice, potatoes, and high carbs food regularly even though the doctor advises us to lessen or cut down from our diet. Fortunately, we bought a blood glucose meter, lancing, and strip but we havent even started using it even though we bought it a week ago. I tried to start caring and managing my Moms diabetes but I am busy with school, I cant drive, nor my sister and mom trust me to go to the grocery store. It was only yesterday when my sister and mom started walking in the park for exercise. My sister also hasn't made any appointment with the eye doctor, leg doctor, nor any other recommended appointments.

The breaking point was my sister telling me that Moms legs were a bit swollen. She said that you should search up messages that lessen the swelling. I researched a bit and told her Swelling in the legs as a diabetic person is serious, I recommend seeing the doctor. Nonetheless, she said research more, there should be messages to lessen the swelling. I researched a bit more and everybody recommended to see the doctor because this could be a sign of serious health issues. I told her exactly that and showed her the article. Yet, she refused to listen and stated that I should google more. I snapback, stating This is a serious issue. Swelling could be a sign of health issues especially for diabetics. My younger sister took my side and told her the exact information. Yet again, she ignored my advice and snapback stating, I am going to be a nurse, I have taken health science classes, I think there should be something to lessen the swelling. I was about to raise my voice but I calmed down. Mom also ignored my advice and thought she was fine. I was a bit tired and started listing out my criticism about her managing mom diabetes. Atlast, she ignored me.

Luckily, summer vacation is coming and I could start managing my Moms diabetes as soon as possible. I cant cook for crap but I am starting to learn. Yet, my mom and sister dont trust me and are probably gonna stay with their same diet. I told them we're gonna need Olive Oil for some meals but I was ignored. We were planning to go on the same diet as my Mom to show support but honestly, I think I am the only one who is gonna follow through with the promise.

tl;dr: The only advice I need is: How could I show the seriousness of my Mom's diabetes?

I forgot the number I think it was 59. After the fluids told me just eat and that's it. Now I'm worried about the low blood sugar. Idk what I should do about it.

somethingsomewhere27,2022-05-13,What do you think of dieters adopting cgm technology?,"I read an article maybe a year or 2 ago about some people on the keto diet using cgms to make sure they were staying in ketosis consistently. I thought the technology was so expensive it'd never take off except a very small number of people. Now I see ads for this type of service all over reddit, using the Libre system. I'm kind of curious to see how other diabetics feel about it. 

I find it at least mildly infuriating. For one, the service is so incredibly expensive. At the lowest cost for an 18 month subscription is $160 per month. I also find it kind of frustrating that these are being advertised as a 100% painless, 100% risk free diet method. While the risk of infection is lower with the cgm than an insulin pump site, that risk is never 0. I also see people in these ads placing them on spots in their body with relatively low fat, meaning the readings they're getting may be more off than even the normal margin of error we're all used to. I also hate the idea from the perspective of someone who had some disordered eating habits. Carb counting is absolutely necessary in some cases, but can make people be way more restrictive in their eating than they should. And especially now as we're experiencing supply chain issues, there may be cgms going out to people who just want to lose weight instead of going to people who actually rely on them to not die. 

That said, there may be a few cultural benefits from something like this. One may be a clearer understanding of just how much sugar is in so much of our food. The second may be that, as this technology becomes more common, it might become cheaper to serve people who's insurance won't cover it or those who don't have insurance. There is also the possibility that for those who are pre-diabetic or have become diabetic, it might help indicate that there's an issue before it becomes an icu stay.",0,0.5,16

38willthisdo,2022-05-14,"How often do you calibrate your glucose meter, and if it was out-of-range, how significant was the value?","I have had T1 for almost 40 years, and Im trying to figure out why my latest A1c was elevated (this is a follow-up question to one I posted several days ago, and Im kind of embarrassed by the question Im asking, so please be kind). Summary: I started my cgm about 7 months ago, and I saw an initial .3% improvement after the first A1c test (everything seemed very straight forward and exciting, given the easiness of using a cgm). My latest GMI indicated my A1C should be 7.0% (I couldnt wait for the A1c to show the improvement). Test came back as a 7.9% (WTF!). A retest 3 days later indicated 8% (%@&amp;%**!)! Endo ordered a fructosamine test to see if A1c test was showing false elevations. It corroborated the A1c test. I have been hitting the TIR goals &gt;70%, and average glucose was 154 mg/dL. My bloodwork came back normal as well (no anemia, etc), and I have been healthy and relatively less-stressed (and not taking excessive NSAIDS). So I calibrate my cgm to my meter, and the values are pretty close. The ONE thing I havent done is to calibrate my meter (it never occurred to me- palm slap to forehead). As a matter of fact.....I have NEVER calibrated my current meter (I did once have an old timey-wimey meter that required a test strip calibration for each bottle of test strips, but that was LONG ago). So Im getting a new meter with calibration solution to see if thats the reason behind the large difference in blood values (endo indicates there can be differences in values between cgm and A1c, but weve eliminated a lot of the more common reasons for elevated A1c values). So is glucose meter calibration something everybody besides me does on a regular basis, and are there significant differences in values when done?",0,0.5,15

Originally after going to my doctor they thought I was having anxiety attacks but after taking blood they noticed my AC1 count was high. I have now been prescribed metamorfin (half pill 2<d7> daily and increase to 1 pill 2x daily if no symptoms) to increase my insulin sensitivity to try to get my body in a healthy state. I have done a small amount of research on diet but previously was eating whatever I wanted for a long time. I also vaped and previous to that smoked marijuanna for around 15 years. (33 years old about 220-230 lbs). This diagnosis has made me quit using marijuana all together. The last week and a half has been filled with ups and downs and I am trying to get to a sustainable state so I can return to work and be more self sufficient.

I have a couple of questions and was hoping for anyone's insight.

How long after making life changes did it take you to start feeling energy and avoid daily dips and peaks?

I have a 2 year old and want to go back to taking walks with him and did today but sorta crashed a bit afterword. I would love to know what people do to avoid dips or peaks before their daily exercise?

What do you do to get through a work day? I am hoping to go back to work when I can and am looking for anything you do that helps you not have symptomatic episodes?

I am currently trying to eat when I feel weak while also hopefully nearing the end of some of the Marijuana withdrawal symptoms and trying to rid myself of a cold. I would love some of your go to meals or snacks as I am currently cutting all processed food, white bread, pasta, juice, soft drinks, sweets and unhealthy snacks . (My favourites). I am trying to develop new love for new foods and if you have any tips or resources you found helpful I would love to know what they are.

blackmoon0114,2022-05-06,How to interpret mg/dl sugar level vs a1c sugar level?,"Hello,

I was diagnosed as pre-diabetic about 8 months ago when my doctor saw that my A1c was 5.9. My mg/dl level in the morning with fasting was \~110. I've seen changed my diet, worked out a lot more. My A1C has shown obvious improvement (5.7 at 2 months ago and 5.3 as of last week). I believe 5.3 would be considered a non-diabetic or normal range. 

However, despite the decrease in my A1C, my mg/dl fasting has been \~110 in the past 8 months, which would still indicate that I'm pre-diabetic. 

I'm not sure how to interpret these discrepancies. Should I trust the A1C test more than the simply mg/dl test that I do at home in the morning? Because one would indicate that I'm now not-diabetic, whereas the other one would say that I'm pre-diabetic. Appreciate any advice here.

himalayanthro,2022-05-23,Am I type 1 or type 2 diabetic?,"Hey everyone! So i was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in the first week of April this year(7th April), after symptoms of severe DKA, fatigue, dizziness, etc. BG levels came out to be 550mg/dL at the time of diagnosis, Hba1c was at 10.4, and high amount of ketones as u wud expect. My doc had me immediately admitted and put on fast-acting insulin for a day. I had been on a mixed insulin ever since(30 bolus/70 basal). For confirmation I then consulted with an endo and he affirmed that I indeed have T1D, and also prescribed a cpeptide test, which I didnt take at that time for some reason.

Fast forward the second week of this month, I saw another doc who had me undergo blood work again, and HbA1c had plummeted to 4.6(and 4.1 just 5-6 days later, is this drastic a decrease even possible in the first place?). C-pep levels were at 0.52. What baffled me is that this doc thinks that mine is rather a case of t2D and has put me on Metformin ever since. Bg levels have slightly worsened ever since compared to when i used to inject insulin(hypos are gone and i have now been seeing 190s after meals vs max of 140s)

&amp;#x200B;

Daughter was diagnosed about 30 days ago with T1D.  She started getting sick along with her brother (not t1d but we will be doing the check), but last night she took a turn and started showing signs of DKA.  She didn't have ketones when we checked at bedtime.  We didn't check again until morning since we were dealing with her not being able to keep anything down (and other bad symptoms).

Her blood sugars have been fine throughout.  She was eating and drinking throughout (not today, not hungry of course).  They still are fine, but now she is sitting in the ER waiting room and it's been 24 hours since she has been able to get any nutrients.

We have no idea how to catch eDKA and so far we haven't run into many professionals that have good advice.  Has anyone in the community gone through this?

Feels like we are going to deal with this each illness, and that is daunting with her being so young and still developing her immune system.",19,0.88,27
ECrispy,2022-05-09,Do you have to cut carbs? What does the science say?,"First lets agree on general nutritional advice that almost agrees on (except for extreme fad diets)

* minimize processed food, eat natural foods
* mostly plant based or vegetarian diet
* prefer complex carbs over simple carbs, low GI over high GI (lentils, beans, whole grains)
* lots of veggies, herbs, spices

Another thing that science universally agrees on - fasting is good, whatever kind of fasting you do.

But low carb/keto is so popular and everyone recommends it for dieting, weight loss and thus diabetes as well. However its very hard to find actual science to back this up.

e.g. for weight loss what matters is caloric deficit, but healthy eating using above principles seems like the best way to do it. Fad diets like Atkins/paleo/keto will produce results but how sustainable are these, esp for those who don't want to eat a meat based western diet.

For diabetes everyone just says reduce carbs. Yet that standard dietary advice from any of the expert bodies, such as ADA, WHO, Harvard health, NHS etc, none of them say 'cut carbs'. There's  such a common tendency to label carbs as evil.

e.g. this study says that low carb diets are neither sustainable, and that their benefits go away after 12 months - [https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/news/20210119/go-low-carb-for-type-2-diabetes-remission](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/news/20210119/go-low-carb-for-type-2-diabetes-remission)

another study I found says that a low/moderate fat vegetarian diet had the same effect on reducing HbA1c as a low carb diet, and may be much more manageable for some people.

There are also Ted talks etc on this.

(edit - adding info about my diet/needs

I was diagnosed with prediabetes. HbA1C 5.9, but I am obese, so advice from my doctor is the same - weight loss and changes in diet.

I'm a vegetarian and cook 99% of my meals, drink almost no soda, my meals consist of asian/middle eastern/indian - so its rice/carbs + lots of veggies/lentils, with occasional pizza/burritos. So for me cutting carbs is going to be very hard. Its not like I can just eat a big piece of meat)

I want to emphasize I'm not saying low carb is bad. I know lots of people have success with it and its a known way to get quick results, esp for those with severe diabetes. But not everyone can eat this way, its a very western style diet. And I'm trying to find out what the actual science says.",0,0.37,20

so i recently started a new regimen with 17u of Levemir at night and 5u of Novorapid for every meal (For now as im still figuring out my I:C ratio etc).
I seemed to have gotten my basal almost right (fasting sugars are 90-130mg/dl) however my bolus is giving me a hard time.

I always always spike after my meals. So i tried to exclude protein and fats thinking maybe they were the culprit but i still ended up spiking. So 5u of novorapid cover my meal and bring me to 140mg/dl postprandially (which i assume would be reasonably good) but then i immediately spike over 200 and stay there for a couple hours until i have to take a correction shot.
I cant ditch carbs as i need to gain weight too.

When youre at a restaurant and they put chips and salsa on the table while you wait for your food, what do you do? I know to wait until my food is physically in front of me before doing my insulin injection for the meal, but I know if I want those chips I have to count them into those numbers and inject before. But then what if the meal takes too long?

Does this make sense? Do I just go without or wait to eat them with my meal? What do you guys do in these situations? Thank you!

Edit: the diabetes educator I met with also explained that alcohol actually lowers blood sugar.

lemoncry_,2022-05-23,How to deal with jealousy and frustration over not being able to eat whatever whenever?,"I know it sounds petty and probably very self centered, but I'm reaching my limit.

 I went low carb since insulin resistance diagnosis 7 months ago, and sure I miss wendy's and soda but man, ditching bread, beans, plaintains, fruits have been the worst part. I miss it so much. It's so hard for me everyday to see my family eat whatever they want whenever they want it, I can't even enjoy traditional food from my country anymore. 

The way others will be hungry, have a snack and be happy while me being hungry means gotta chug down water in hopes it kills the hunger and wait till dinner because if I eat anything I'm terrified it'll make me go high. I'm sure I've developed disordered eating, extreme carbs fear, bad health anxiety. It's awful.

I find myself avoiding eating with others because all I can do is see what they're eating and wish I was having those potatoes and lemonade. It kills me every time.

Yes, I've tried looking out for options, but homemade keto bread taste like egg, can't affond a 13$ maple sugar free maple syrup, can't even have a lot of my favorite vegetables (like brussel sprouts or carrots) without going up 30 points 1 hour post meal. Portion control is another issue, it makes me even more depressed to have *just* a tablespoon of beans or 1/3 of rye bread. I want more.

I'm truly envious of those around me, it sounds awful, but I want to just eat without counting the carbs of everything. I want to have fruit without issue but I can't.. I know I cant, and it makes me so angry I don't know how to deal with it.

Well, after some funky vision the last week, today I just got diagnosed (by a totally separate retinal specialist) with Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion.

I said that perhaps using packets of turbinado sugar would be better, as it wouldn't stick to my teeth as much, and most of it would just go down my throat. She started cracking up again, and said she couldn't recommend anything along those lines.

They are very careful about not giving a deadline to any of this. So some of the dissappintment or frustration might be coming from assumptions or previous memories.

hardcoredragonhunter,2022-05-12,Why dont these doctors just refill the freaking insulin prescriptions!?,"Im a 22 year old man and Ive been Type 1 since I was 14.

Mt-Implausible,2022-05-07,"Doctors Making ""cinnamon type recommendations""?","I (t2) Went to my doctor today after getting blood work. A1C was 6.9 and I'm working to improve it further. He goes on about how I have to make significant lifestyle changes to my diet without asking what my diet is like. I have listed most of his comments below. I found it very annoying but also wondering if there is any reasoning behind any of this that I should be listening to. 

Avoid rice, bread etc but potatoes are fine. 
Drink only organic milk
Eat only organic eggs 
Avoid eating anything from a can (do not use, canned tuna, canned beans, chickpeas, coconut milk or tomatoes)
Only eat wild caught white fish
Do not have anything carbonated (club soda included) 
Go gluten free

And finally ""have you considered losing weight, it's not that hard"". I feel like I am going insane.

likeapatient,2022-04-25,This has to change. People are dying because of this shit. Insurance is the death panel.,"I'm furious right now y'all. My husband has been a T1D for the last three years or so. He uses a Dexcom to monitor his blood sugar. We pay out the wazoo for a premium insurance plan with Anthem because both of us have significant health issues. 

He learned today via the Anthem claims portal that we owe $3000 for his recent Dexcom order via US Med (medical supplier). We hadn't been paying anything up to this point for them (other than the high monthly premiums to Anthem), as it was covered in our plan as a durable medical device. 

Well, apparently a few months ago, Anthem decided to change their coverage policy for CGMs (constant glucose monitors). They will now no longer be included in medical coverage but under pharmacy 'benefits.' Apparently, Anthem informed us of this change some time in January via hard copy letter (which we never received). We received no other notifications about this change, no emails, nothing. As such, a we received a normal delivery of CGMs a couple of weeks ago and thought nothing of it, as we weren't aware of any policy changes. 

Fast forward to a couple of days ago, he needs to put on a new device, and that's when he happened look at his claims on Anthem, and we discovered the $3k charge. My husband is currently without a CGM on because we are afraid to open the box and be charged the $3000 for it, which is a significant amount of money for us. We are beyond the thirty days to return it to the medical supplier. So, we are in limbo. And Anthem is running us around their phone tree this morning, even connecting him to a fax line at one point. He's going to have to take off the whole day to deal with this administrative issue.

On top of all this, we are likely going to have to pay $200-300 a month now for diabetes supplies where we were not before. We asked Anthem for the actual cost, and ""they couldn't tell us yet."" 

Apparently, CGMs are being pushed/marketed towards T2Ds (which is great!), but it feels like Anthem is changing its coverage because they are having to spend so much covering ALL diabetics. This is educated speculation, but it feels on point for how shitty these insurance companies truly are.

I hate this. It's wrong. I can't imagine if we were in a less privileged position (mind you, we're only middle class). I feel awful for the elderly folks and less educated people that have to navigate this system. Or those that can barely function on a day-to-day basis due to their illness. They just die I guess. This kind of thing is so fucked up and makes me want to run for political office. People will die because they can't navigate this system. Time for a change.",189,0.97,68

They have single use pens of insulin one for slow release and one for fast release, they put a new needle on when they open a new pen then keep that same needle for the entire life of that pen then throw it away with that needle.

I'm concerned that not changing the needle for every injection as is recommended on the needle box is going to cause problems for them later on in life.

They told me when confronted about this that nobody changes their needle every time as its far too inconvenient to carry needles and a sharps box and any way to make their life easier as as diabetic is worth the risk and pain of using a needle more then once their also very very poor at managing their blood sugar and wake up every morning sweating and having blood sugar levels around 18 or 19.

ECrispy,2022-05-11,What do they mean when they say 'you can reverse T2 diabetes' ?,"I know there is a lot of debate on this topic in the medical community - the official word from the governing bodies of doctors everywhere is that its a progressive disease that is irreversible and can only be controlled.

Yet there are also many doctors, and many non medical people, who will claim that no, it can be 'reversed'. It can't be a coincidence that almost all of these have youtube channels, are selling their own books/programs etc. 

My qn is simple. When they make this claim does it mean ? - 

1. you can bring your glucose sensitivity/HbA1c levels down to normal levels, stop taking meds maybe, with diet/lifestyle changes. But you have to keep this up the rest of your life and always watch what you eat (in practice this means you can't eat a lot of things)
2. you are now free of T2 and can go back to normal lifestyle, eat what you want. There are plenty of overweight/obese people without diabetes. So you can go back e.g. to eating desserts, fast food etc

My guess is its actually 1. From what I understand the metabolic changes that cause T2 happen at a cellular/basic level, and have a lot to do with genetics, and once this switch is flipped (which can take a while) it stays there, which is what is meant by 'irreversible'. 

This is really no different than what most doctors will say, its a permanent condition that needs to be managed forever. Yet the people who say it can be reversed make all these sensational claims which IMO are very misleading.

SCB360,2022-05-16,Getting concerned with the lack of weight loss despite my best efforts,"I was diagnosed with Type 2 a year or so ago and didnt take it serious at all, I genuinely didnt care or know the consequences but a few months ago I started wanting to get better in general not helped by some sexual issues with ED and phibosis that I have as well

My blood sugars were 108 (not sure on the measurement going off the Dr saying this) and was given a machine to measure my mmol level and to get it down from late 20s to between the safe 4-7 mmol,

So I started running, couch to 5k has been fantastic, I feel fitter, my tiredness is gone and combined with a dirty Keto diet its been helping a lot, I have trouble eliminating all carbs(mainly bread) but sugar is almost gone and the cravings are no longer there, all positive stuff

However the issue is my weight, Im still at 248lbs or there abouts and after 6 weeks Im kinda expecting more, in fact Ive gained weight by a few pounds and my ED is still an issue( Silfenadil is not that effective however seeing a Urologist tomorrow as Ive had issues in the past and in sex therapy as well) 

Could it be the gaining of muscle from running? Medication? (Metaformin and empaglozin, though the latter is on a break for a different more effective drug, I forget its name atm)


EDIT:

Thanks for all the support and detailed stuff to look through, its really tough mentally some days but I'm getting there, maybe 6 weeks isn't a long time for much to change, but I expected more if I'm honest, but I have some positive changes

So, I'm going to drop all carbs where I can, so that even if I have a few g's its still way under a daily total

Lift, well at least bodyweight stuff on non running days to start

Track measurements, this seems to be a good idea to rule out if its just muscle gain replacing fat or not",9,0.81,42

I am very frustrated and want to cut contact for a while from everyone. I feel immense guilt removing them from following my sensor. I feel like they just use it to keep tabs on me, but they dont bother calling me or checking in on me in other ways. The only time i will hear from them is when my blood sugar is low. It hurts me because I feel like I am receiving the bare minimum in a relationship. Its like just because Im a diabetic, they get some special way to monitor me without actually talking to me. In a way it feels like they have some kind of control over me. I have had them threaten me when I remove them from my sensor. (Remove me from the car insurance, call the cops for a wellness check etc.) I dont know if Im a jerk for worrying them so much, but Im tired of the way things are. I sometimes just want to take a break from my phone and I feel blackmailed from my own disease and family members to be forced to share my sensor with them and have my phone by me 24/7. 

Yes Im in therapy, therapist actually recommended asking this sub.

Doneson22,2022-05-25,Question for diabetic coffee drinkers,"Just tried my first plain coffee (its actually an iced americano - maybe its worse than just black?) after diagnosis and I gagged lol. I havent had caffeine in more than a year but due to schedule changes at work, I find myself needing a pick me up. The only problem is, Im fasting as well during this window. Is it possible to add anything to black coffee to make it taste better? I know being that Im fasting theres little I can do but Im willing to mess with my fasting window on those days I badly need it. 

My usual order in the past was a cafe mocha from Starbucks but theres too much sugar so Im looking for something better. Im also curious as to what your coffee order/routine is so pls share! Id like to know what sweeteners dont spike you or maybe even sugar free syrups or any creamers added. Thanks in advance!",4,1,39
MrMomma93,2022-05-05,Does Diabetes give you a free pass?,"Ok... So a little back story. I (28f) live with my daughter(8) and had my boyfriend (36) of a little over a year move in last June. If it helps you understand our personalities better, I'm a Cancer, and he's a Scorpio. He also has type 1 Diabetes, and has since he was 4.

Because of this I've always done my best to be patient and help him in any way that I can. But because of our personalities and maybe our communication style, I often feel like anything I say is taken the wrong way. Him as well, because he can be a bit loud and repetitive sometimes and it can get under my skin. I'm a bit more reserved than him as a person, and overall more quiet. He on the other hand could talk anyone's ear off, and is so much more outgoing than I am. Now I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that. But his temper is also at that level.

The past year that we've lived together, we've had so many fights and disagreements. I've literally never fought with someone so much. I'm quiet as hell, if you met me you probably wouldn't even remember me. So it takes a lot to make me raise my voice. Being with him has for some reason brought out all this anger in me, I don't know if it's unaddressed trauma from past experiences or just his own crazy bringing out my crazy. Our worst fight was probably Christmas day when I had to call the cops. Again, just backstory that's already been handled.

What happened tonight though is just weighing heavy on my mind and making me wonder if I am in the wrong this time. His diabetes can be bad at times, and he hasn't always been the best at taking care of himself/eating right, he's admitted this himself. And I always try to make sure he's ok, eating enough, and checking his blood sugar.

Tonight when I was making supper, he was playing his game (2K) and getting frustrated with it as usual. His blood sugar had been running a bit low all day as well but we had lunch and always have more than enough to snack on or drink. He's kind of bad about making himself food though, I've noticed and only really eats if I make him food. Which I'm fine with because I enjoy cooking, but it also makes me feel like his lows are sometimes my fault. He lashes out a bit sometimes when he's low and even when he's not he just never grabs something to eat or makes himself anything. I understand type 1 Diabetes is the worst and when you're low it makes basically makes it to where your brain doesn't function properly. But mix that with the fact that we've always kind of fought a lot. This situation just sucks all around.

As I was finishing up with supper, he was playing his game and kept complaining (he can be a bit over-dramatic at times) ""He's dying"" and that he's been low all day. Mind you he has two feet and can come grab something from the kitchen whenever. And so after he said this a few times I was a bit tired and said ""I'm literally almost done with supper, can you please stop being so dramatic?"" And so that prompts the screaming at me from him, because he's a diabetic and could die from his blood sugar being low. Which I completely understand and try to help him with all the time. It literally just escalates from there. So he's screaming at me, and I'm screaming back because I'm quiet and have to shout over people to be heard. My daughter's in the living room scared and crying in her tent at this point. And when I go to comfort her he starts screaming things like ""Why is she crying, she's not the one that's low?!""

I literally just can't.

Like I understand type 1 Diabetes is bad, but does it just give you a pass to be a complete asshole to everyone around you? I guess what I asking is, am I the asshole for asking my diabetic boyfriend to apologize to my daughter for scaring her?

Just to clarify: I already apologized to my daughter for my part in all this, held her close and told her none of the fighting was her fault. I've always tried to be the best mom I can be for her, it's always been just us. I was just asking him to apologize to her for what he said directed at her, nothing else, because she was scared. What child wouldn't be scared of a grown man screaming at the top of his lungs like a lunatic?",1,0.53,32

Lectric74,2022-05-12,Substitution for bread,"Hi everybody, newly diagnosed T2 2 weeks ago. Also dealing with high triglycerides and high BP. Not overweight, but not the healthiest diet leading up to this. Runs heavily in my family so I honestly wasn't that surprised, other than taking until I was 47. Currently taking metformin and checking 3 times a day. Target range 80-130 and I've been changing my diet to help but sandwiches are my downfall. Saturday through this morning I've been in range, but 1 sandwich with 13g carbs per slice and I jumped to 178. 

I know it's the bread, but I enjoy a good sandwich around midday as a first meal. What can I do to do have easy to make sandwiches without spiking my levels? Are there any lower carb bread options that I'm just not seeing? I work late(it's about 2 am right now) and wake around noon, light lunch, then start work, so quick, easy to make, and inexpensive are the goals.

Edit: after dinner a few hours later I was back down to 124, even last night with a higher carb dinner I stayed 117. It's just the sandwiches which consist of Miracle Whip, wheat bread, ham/turkey/chicken, slice of cheese, and a bit of relish, or tuna with some relish and miracle whip, or even boiled eggs, all spike the number.",2,0.67,30

MarcusForrest,2022-05-17,Reminder: Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) is not CAUSED by hyperglycemia but by insulin insufficiency/deficiency (which can lead to hyperglycemia),"I've seen this erroneous detail a few times in this sub-reddit so I feel it is important to share the accurate information:

&amp;nbsp;

**Diabetic Ketoacidosis** _(also known by its initials DKA)_ isn't _caused_ by hyperglycemia, **it occurs when absolute or relative insulin deficiency** inhibits the ability of glucose to enter cells for utilization as metabolic fuel, the result being that the liver rapidly breaks down fat into ketones to employ as a fuel source.^1

&amp;nbsp;

#<cf> What does it mean?

It means that DKA isn't actually caused by hyperglycemia, but by a lack of insulin.

&amp;nbsp;

#<cf> What's the link with hyperglycemia, then?

Insulin insufficiency or deficiency also leads to hyperglycemia, so one often comes with the other. Insulin insufficiency can lead to both hyperglycemia and DKA.

&amp;nbsp;

#<cf> Is DKA possible with regular blood glucose levels?

Absolutely - it is known as **Euglycemic DKA** and much like ''regular'' DKA, it can be life threatening. It is sometimes harder to notice or diagnose because the individual is not in hyperglycemia - this is why ketone testing is very important.

&amp;nbsp;

Another important detail about **Euglycemic DKA** is that people taking SGLT2 inhibitors medications are more likely to develop DKA / euDKA **especially if combined with a KETO diet.** As a diabetic, **always** discuss with your health professional before drastic diet changes.

&amp;nbsp;

#<cf> What's the difference between **Ketoacidosis** and **Ketosis?**

* **Ketosis** is a metabolic state the body goes into when it doesn't have enough glycogen from carbohydrates to burn for energy.^2

* **Ketoacidosis** is a complication of diabetes (typically Type 1) that causes the body to produce excess blood acids due to overwhelming ketosis - the body creates too much ketone, and as ketones are regulated by **insulin** and there isn't enough insulin, acid accumulates in the body.^2

&amp;nbsp;

#<cf> How is ketoacidosis treated?

&amp;nbsp;

<a0> _**This isn't meant as medical advice, just as information**_

&amp;nbsp;

Ketoacidosis is treated with **insulin, water** _(and electrolytes)_ **and carbohydrates**

* **Insulin** to regulate ketones
* **Water** _and electrolytes_ to fix the dehydration and restore electrolyte balance and fluid levels
* **Carbohydrates** for the body to get glucose-based fuel and stop ketosis, which in this case leads to ketoacidosis


&amp;nbsp;

_In order to know more about corrective doses, **contact your health professional/endocrinologist** - correction factor is unique to everyone, there is no ''one-size-fit-all'' solution to Diabetes, sadly_ 

The use of insulin as a ketone regulator is why, as mentioned earlier, insulin loses efficacy in lowering blood glucose when in a ketoacidosis state - on one hand, part of the insulin is working on regulating ketones, on the other, parts of it is working on regulating blood glucose.

&amp;nbsp;

<a0> _**Again, always consult your health professional**_

&amp;nbsp;

**Insulin isn't just a blood glucose regulator, it is also a ketone regulator** and affects various processes in the body, typically linked to energy storage, production or use.

&amp;nbsp;

#<cf> Can I test my ketone levels at home?

&amp;nbsp;

There are at least 2 ways to test at home:

* Through **urine** - there are _**test strips**_ for urine ketones usually available at drugstores/pharmacies. While not as accurate as blood ketone testing, it can still give an idea of ketone levels in the body.
 * Very simple, you simply urinate on a strip and compare the colour to a chart
* Through **blood** much like blood glucose readers, there exists **Ketone Blood Readers/Meters**
 * Same deal as blood glucose meters: finger prick, get a drop of blood, get that blood on a test strip plugged in the reader, wait a few seconds, and you'll get your results

&amp;nbsp;

**ABOUT BOOD KETONES LEVELS**

If you do a blood ketone test:^3

VALUE|=<ca>|COMMENT
--:|:--:|:--
d than 0.6mmol/L|=<9a>| It is a normal, healthy reading
0.6 to 1.5mmol/L|=<e1>|You're at a slightly increased risk of DKA and you should test again in 2 hours
e 1.6 to 2.9mmol/L|=6|You're at an increased risk of DKA and should **contact your diabetes team or GP as soon as possible**
&gt; 3mmol/L|=<e5>|You have a very high risk of DKA and should **get medical help immediately**

&amp;nbsp;

<a0> If your ketone levels are slightly higher, **make sure you have a procedure to prevent it from aggravating. Consult your diabetes team to establish a plan, which usually includes water, food and insulin intake.**

&amp;nbsp;

_____________________________

All these details are important to understand, as DKA can also be a factor in why a corrective dose doesn't seem to work as expected - above certain thresholds, corrective doses need to be adjusted, as part of the insulin is used to ''fix'' the DKA while another part focuses on breaking down glucose - so not _all_ that corrective insulin is used on the glucose.

&amp;nbsp;

**<a0> Remember, this thread is not medical advice - always consult your health professional as any change can be potentially hazardous.** It may help learn about specific aspects of Diabetes and can lead to discussion, but please, do not take anything here as guidelines, especially as **diabetes is different for everyone**
